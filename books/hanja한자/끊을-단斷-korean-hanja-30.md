It's been a long time since I started podcasting about the Chinese Characters in Korean. As usual, the series ends with the 30th episode and the last character is 끊을 단(斷), meaning cutting down.

#  Cut

When you cut down something, the character, 끊을 단 is used.

절단(切斷) means to cut down. 절 here means cutting down.
단절(斷絶) means cut off or gap. 절 here also means cutting down. Although 단 in 절단 and 단절 sounds the same, they are different characters.

철조망을 절단하는 것이 가장 확실한 방법이겠지만, 그건 시간이 너무 오래 걸려.
Cutting down the barbed-wire is the best way, but it takes a lot of time.

부모와 자식 간의 소통의 단절을 해결해 주는 일을 하고 있어요.
I am now trying to solve the problem of the communication gap between the parents and the children.

#  Stop.

When the progress of certain work is cut down, it means to stop the work. Because of that, 단 sometimes means to stop.

중단(中斷) means to suspend or halt. When some work was on the way but it was stopped for some reason, it is called 중단 in Korean.
단수(斷水) means cutting the water. It is not usual in Korea, but sometimes the water stops because of some repair or maintenance.

환경 문제로 공사를 중단할 수밖에 없었다.
Because of the environmental problem, the construction had to be stopped.

오후 1시부터 3시까지 물탱크 청소로 인해 단수가 있겠습니다.
Because of the cleaning of the water tank, the water will be not supplied from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.

#  Decide

After you think and research for some project, you should stop thinking at some point and decide and do something. For this case, 끊을 단 has the meaning, decide.

판단(判斷) means judge or decision. 판 means judge here.
독단(獨斷) means on one's own. It is usually used with 결정하다, decide, in the form of 독단적으로 결정하다, meaning deciding on one's own. 독 here means alone.

잘못된 판단이 결국 큰 실수를 낳았다.
His wrong decision made a great mistake.

그가 독단적으로 내린 결정 때문에 많은 사람들이 그를 떠났다.
Because he decided on his own, many people left him.

This is the end of the Korean Hanja Series. I always told you about the next series this time. Sadly, there is no next series planned. Instead, I am going to publish other posts about Korean. I planned about them for a long time, but I couldn't do that because this daily podcast is a big thing. Thank you for listening until the end. I will see you with some new and informative posts soon.
