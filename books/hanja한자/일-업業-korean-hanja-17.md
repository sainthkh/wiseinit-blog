All of us work until the end of our lives. The character we are going to learn today is 일 업(業). It means works. You can find this character in many words.

#  농업/공업/상업/어업

This character is used to call many kinds of works.

농업(農業) is agriculture. 농 means farming.
공업(工業) is industry. 공 means craftsman.
상업(商業) is commerce. 상 means merchant.
어업(漁業) is fishing industry. 어 means fish.

대한민국 농업이 더 발전할 수 있도록 도와주는 연구 결과가 공개되었다.
The research result that can improve the agriculture of Korea now became public.

그 소설은 상업에 종사하는 분들의 괴로움을 잘 표현했다.
That novel well expressed the hardships of the people working in commerce.

경찰은 불법 어업을 단속 중이다.
The police are cracking down illegal fishing.

#  파업/분업/실업

업 is also used for other works related to business.

파업(罷業) means strikes. 파 means to end or give up.
분업(分業) means division of labor. 분 means divide.
실업(失業) means losing job. 실 means losing some object, not losing the game or war.

노조는 결국 파업을 하기로 결정했다.

As the unemployed are now increasing, the government is trying to make plans for it.

#  입학/졸업

When you are entering a school, it is called 입학(入學) in Korean. 입 here means to come and 학 means to study, so it means you are coming to study. However, the graduation is 졸업(卒業). 졸 means to end. 업 means the work we've learned today. It is a bit weird. As you ended the study in a school, it looks like it should be 졸학, not 졸업.

It is said that ancient Koreans thought that the study is endless. It is the work that you should do it until your death, so they used work or 업 instead of study or 학. In your graduation, you just ended your assigned works, not the study itself, so the graduation became 졸업.

군대 때문에 남학생들은 대학 입학 후 졸업까지 평균적으로 6~7년 정도 걸린다.
Because of the army, it takes about 6-7 years for male students to graduate after entering universities.
