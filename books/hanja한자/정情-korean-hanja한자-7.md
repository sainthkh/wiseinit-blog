We will talk about 정, today. It is a simple and single character, but it is hard to define the meaning. Let's talk what this letter means one by one.

#  Used Alone: Affection

The basic meaning of 정 is meaning. However, it is more used in the sense of affection, love, friendliness. It is used alone with the verbs like 들다(to come in), 떨어지다(to drop), 쏟다(to pour).

When you say 정이 들다, you made bond with your friends or colleagues. As one of the meaning of 들다 is coming in, the affection came between the people as they live on, so it means to become fond of.
