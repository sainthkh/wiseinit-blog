Many things have order. If one thing is in the front, other things are in the back. To describe these order, Koreans use 전(前) and 후(後).

#  전반전/후반전

If you love sports, you might know the words, first half and second half. They are called 전반전(前半戰) and 후반전(後半戰) in Korean. In 전반전, it has 2 전s. The first 전 means front and second 전 means war. It is same 전 in 전쟁(戰爭).

전반전에는 1:0으로 1점 뒤지고 있었지만, 후반전에 2골을 넣어 역전했다.
In the first half, the score was 1:0. Our team was 1 point behind. However, we added 2 goals in the second half and turned the game around.

By the way, overtime or extra time in the match is called 연장전.

#  전진/후진

전 and 후 are used to talk about moving. Moving or going forward is 전진 and backward is 후진.

후진할 때에는 전진할 때보다 더 조심해야 해.
When moving backward, you should be more careful than moving forward.

#  전 대통령, 전 서울 시장, 전 남편,

When we talk about former presidents, mayors, husbands or wives, we sometimes use ex- like ex-president, ex-mayor, ex-husband, etc. In Korean, the letter 전 is used to call them like 전 대통령, 전 서울 시장, 전 남편. As 전 means front, it is used to call the front part in time, so it got this meaning.

전 대통령들의 업적에 대해 공부해 보고 있다.
I am now studying the works of ex-presidents.

When you are talking about the previous jobs of a person, the word, 전직(前職), is used in the place of simple 전. 직(職) here means work or job.

전직 배우였던 아내를 둔 소설가 남 씨는 오늘 신작 소설을 내 놓았다.
Novelist, Nam, who has ex-actress as his wife, released a new novel today.

#  후기

We learned 일기 yesterday. It got this meaning because you wrote about your day. If we change 일 with 후, it becomes review or epilogue. If it is a review about a product, it is 상품 후기. If it is about the success of a plan or program, it is 성공 후기. If it is about the experience of using something, then it is 사용 후기.

물건이 괜찮아서 후기에 쓰고 싶은 것이 많았어요.
As the product is good, I had so many things to write in the review.

사용 후기를 쓰려고 생각해 보니, 써야 할 것이 너무 많다.
When I decided to write reviews, there are so many things to write.

#  Other words

전작 is used to call previous works. 작(作) here means works like novel, movie, games, etc.

In military terms, there is 전방 and 후방. If you are close to North Korea, the main enemy of the Korean Army, it is 전방. If you are far from them, it is 후방. I worked in 전방 and the place is the most northern part of Korea.

The word, 후유증(後遺症), also has 후 in it. 유 means left. It basically means the disease left behind and the word means aftereffect or sequela.
