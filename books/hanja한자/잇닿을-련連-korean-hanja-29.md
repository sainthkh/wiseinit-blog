The characters we will learn today is 잇닿을 련(連).

The first meaning of 련 is to be side by side. When you make some things side by side, then they are connected, so it means connect. If similar things are side by side, it is continuous. Because of that, 련 is used to describe something continuous.

연결(連結) means connect. 결 here means to make a knot. When you connect two strings, you should make a knot in the end. That's why 결 is there.
연락(連絡) means contact. 락 here means connect. Contacts connect people.
연휴(連休) means long weekend or holidays. 휴 here means to take rest. Many holidays in Korea are decided by dates. Because of that, some holidays are located in Fridays or Mondays. Then, weekend becomes longer. These holidays are called 연휴. Some holidays like 설날 and 추석 are longer than others by themselves. Because of that, they are also called 연휴.

#  Continuous win or lose?

There is an interesting word in Korean. It is 연패. It sometimes mean continuous wins and it means continuous lose in other times. Actually, those two words are different word in Hanja. Continuous win is 連覇 and continuous lose is 連敗. 패 in win is a bit more complicated than win. These are a bit confusing, but they have their own context. When a team continuously loses games in a single season. The word 연패 is used to describe it. However, they found their problem and started to win games in that season, then it is 연승(連勝). 승 is from 승리(勝利), victory.
On the other hand, when a team continuously win the league for several seasons, the word 연패(連覇) is used there. It is hard to find people using 연승 for the continuous final wins.

연승: Continuous wins in a single season
연패(連覇): Continuous final wins in the league
연패(連敗): Continuous loses in a single season
