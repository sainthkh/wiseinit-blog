There is less slave these days than before. There is no slavery in Korea. I heard that there are still some of them in other countries. However, nearly 100 years ago, there were many slaves in Korea, too. Slaves have their masters. These masters are called 주인 in Korean. We will learn the word, 주인 주(主), today.

#  주인

The basic meaning of 주 is master, lord. Like masters owning slaves, some people have building or some system. Because of that, 주 is sometimes used for the owner of building or system.

주인(主人) is master, lord, or owner. 인 here means person.
민주주의(民主主義) is democracy. Demo- means people and -cracy means rule. It means the ruling by the people. 민 here means people or citizens and 주의 means ideology. 민주주의 is the ideology of all people becoming masters of the nation.

이 건물의 주인이 누구인가?
Who is the owner of this building?

많은 사람들이 민주주의를 지키기 위해 노력했다.
Many people tried to protect democracy.

#  Main

As masters are considered more important than slaves, 주인 주 is also used for the meaning, main. Actually, it seems that the words that have 주 as meaning of main are more frequent than lord or master.

주연(主演) and 주인공(主人公) are main character. They mean similar but there is a little difference. 연 here means spread or acting. When a story is played in web, TV, radio, theater, etc., the person that acts the main character or that person's acting is called 주연. 주인공 is the main character in the story. Because of that, 주요 is not used like "소설 해리 포터 시리즈의 주연은 해리 포터이다," it should be 주인공 there.
주요(主要) means main. 요 here means to need something.
주제(主題) means theme or main topic. 제 means title.

조연만 10년 넘게 하다가 주연을 맡게 되니 많이 떨립니다.
I have acted as a supporting character for more than 10 years, but I will play as leading role this time. It makes me really nervous.

이 게임 주인공 너무 불쌍한 것 같아.
The main character of this game is too miserable.

#  Other Words

주어(主語) is the subject. 어 means word. Subject is the main character in the sentence. That's why 주 is there.
Lord Jesus Christ is 주 예수 그리스도 in Korean. Many Christians in Korea call Sunday as 주일(Lord's day in word by word translation).
