No one leaves alone. We all live with someone else and help them and get help from them. It is called society in English and 사회(社會) in Korean. 사 and 회 here mean gathering. We will learn the character, 회, in more detail today.

#  회의(會議)

회의 is meeting in companies. 의 here means discussion. So 회의 basically means the gathering of discussions. To gather the discussions, you should have a meeting. That's why 회의 means meeting.

회의 시간에 늦지 않게 도착해 주시기 바랍니다.
Please arrive early and don't be late for the meeting.

우리 회사 회의는 시작하면 한 시간이야.
More than an hour is passed after the meeting in our company began.

#  대회(大會)

When there is a contest, really a lot of people gather together. Because of that, contests are called 대회 in Korean. 대 here means big or magnificent.

이번 대회 우승자는 누구일까요?
Who will finally win this contest?

대회를 여러 번 나가 보니 알 것 같다.
I can understand it as I participated contests several times.

#  회원(會員)/회비(會費)

In many societies, there are regulars. These regular people are usually called members in English and 회원 in Korean. 원 here means people, so 회원 is the member in the group.

In some groups, you have to pay membership fee to participate. 회비 is the fee for the membership. 비 here means consume or expenditure.

회원들의 숫자가 중요한 것이 아니다.
The number of members is not important.

이번 모임 회비는 3만원입니다.
The fee for the next meeting is 30,000 won.

#  Other Words

회사(會社) means company or corporation. 사 here also means gathering. Companies gather people to earn money. That's why those characters are used. Actually, 회 and 사 for companies are the same 사 and 회 in 사회, society. It is just the reversal of the characters.

회담(會談) means conference or talks. 담 here means talking. Many of you have heard of or love the Korean TV show, Abnormal Summit. It is 비정상회담 in Korean. Actually, this name used the ambiguity of the word well. The summit is called 정상회담 in Korean and 정상 here means the head of nations, not being normal. However, by adding the 비 in front of the word which means not, it doesn't only mean the non-head of the nations but also mean abnormal.

교회(敎會) means church. It is used for Protestant Churches for most cases. 교 here means to teach. The basic meaning of 교회 is the group of people who teach each other.
