In English, if there is un, dis, im in front of a word, then it has a reversed meaning. There are similar characters in Korean. They are 아닐 비(非) and 아닐 미(未).

#  비(非)

비 means not. The examples of 비 are like these:

비상(非常) means emergency. 상 here means normal or usual. If something is not in the usual state, then it is emergency.
비행(非行) means misdeed or wrongdoing. 행 means to do. It is usually used in the form of 비행 청소년, bad juvenile. Many of you thought the word, flying. The 비 in 비행, flying is 날 비(飛) meaning to fly.
비정(非情) means cold-hearted. 정 is the warm heart that we learned before. If it is not warm hearted, it is cold-hearted.

미리 대책을 세워 둔 덕택에 비상 사태를 빨리 해결할 수 있었다.
Thanks to the plans I made earlier, I could handle the emergency fast.

안 좋은 영상을 많이 본 어린이들이 비행 청소년이 된다는 연구 결과가 있다.
There is a research result that the kids who watched bad videos become wrong-doing teenagers.

어렸을 때는 아버지가 비정한 것 같았는데, 지금은 생각이 달라졌다.
When I was young, I thought that my father was cold-hearted, but my mind has been changed now.

#  미(未)

미 also means not. There are examples like following.

미래(未來) means future. 래(來) here means to come, so 미래 means something that hasn't been come. It is in the future.
미달(未達) means fall short. 달 means to meet, satisfy, or arrive. 미달 means unable to get to the expected or decided number, so it is fall short.
미지(未知) means unknown. 지 here means to know. It is obvious why it got this meaning.

미래 도시가 이 작품의 주제야.
The future city is the main theme of this work.

정원이 미달이지만, 그래도 운영이 가능할 것 같아.
Although the limit number of students are not reached yet, we can run it somehow.

미지의 세계로 여행을 떠나 볼까?
How about traveling to the unknown world?

In Newspapers

Actually, these 2 characters appear in newspapers a lot.

非이공계 is not 이공계(natural science or engineering).
非지상파 is not 지상파(ground wave, it is usually used to call 3 broadcasting systems in Korea: KBS, SBS, MBC).
非수도권 is not 수도권(near Seoul).

未성년 is not 성년(adult).
未착용 is not 착용(wearing something like seatbelt).
未개정 is not 개정(revision).

Thank you for listening and I have an announcement. There will be a short season break after this episode. The next Korean Hanja episode # 21 will be on air on July 13th. Meanwhile, I will answer the questions about Hanja with video clips. Stay tuned!
