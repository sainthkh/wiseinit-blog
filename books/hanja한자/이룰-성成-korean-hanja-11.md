We all want success, but most of us fail. Many successful people advise that you should daily improve your life and work to succeed. To improve something, we should accomplish what we have planned. Because of that, in success, there is a character 이룰 성(成). 이루다 means complete, accomplish, finish.

#  성공

성공(成功) consists of the 2 characters, 이룰 성(成) and 공 공(功). Although we read it as 공 공, it has nothing to do with balls. It means contribution or credit. The basic meaning of 성공 in Korean is to achieve and contribute. When someone succeeds, he or she made really huge contribution to the society. Then, it is easy for you to understand why 성공 is success.

성공의 비결은 특이한 것이 아니라, 다 우리가 한 번쯤은 들어 봤지만 실천하지 못하고 있는 것들이다.
The secrets of success are not something special. They are what we have once heard of but we are not practicing.

성공과 실패는 얼마나 꾸준히 일해 나가느냐가 결정하는 거야.
Success and fail are decided by how much we consistently work for it.

#  성장

As I said in the last lecture, 장(長) means long. If someone or something grows up, he or she or it becomes bigger and longer, so 성장 means growing up.

경제를 성장시키기 위해 모두들 노력 중이다.
Everyone is trying hard for the growth of the economy.

아이가 육체적으로 그리고 정서적으로 잘 성장하려면 부모의 도움이 필요하다.
The helps of parents are necessary for the kids to grow physically and emotionally.

#  완성

완 in 완성(完成) means complete or perfect. If you completely accomplish something, then it means you finished it or completed it, so 완성 means completion of works.

그림을 완성하고 나니 밤 10시였다.
When I finished the picture, it was 10 p.m.

IS를 제거할 전략은 아직 미완성인 상태라고 백악관은 발표했다.
The White House announced that the plan to eliminate IS is not completed yet.

미(未) here is used as prefix for not. Other examples of 미(未) are 미공개(not publicly disclosed), 미확정(not decided yet), etc.

#  Other words

성인(成人) is adult. Adults completed growing up.
성적(成績) is your grade. 적 here means weaving a cloth. I guess that you accomplish making a pretty and long cloth after weaving, so it got the meaning achievement. That's why 성적 is used to tell what you have achieved in school.
