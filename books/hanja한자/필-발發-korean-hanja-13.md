The World War I started after the assassination of heir to the throne in Austria. Like this, some firing can start a great war. The character we will learn today is 필 발(發). It has the meaning, shoot. Like World War I, shooting can start a war, so it also means start.

Actually, the first meaning 필 is one of the conjugation of the verb, 피다. The basic meaning of 피다 is to blossom. It is used like 꽃이 피다(A flower blossomed). It is less frequently used in that form these days, so the basic meaning of 필 발 became 쏠 발 in Windows Hanja auto completion window.
