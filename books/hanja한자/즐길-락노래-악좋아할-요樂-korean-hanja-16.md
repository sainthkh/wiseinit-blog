Koreans read almost all character with a single sound. If it is 정(情), it is always 정. It is not changed. However, there are some exceptions. Actually, we learned one exception before. It is 쇠 금. When it is for metal, it is 금. When it is for family name, it is 김.

We will learn another multi-sound character today. It is 즐길 락(樂). It basically has 3 sounds, 락, 악, 요. We will see each.

#  즐길 락

Its most famous sound is 락. It is usually read as 락. It means 즐기다, having fun or enjoy. The following are the examples of 즐길 락:

#  쾌락

쾌락(快樂) is pleasure. 쾌 means happy, delightful, pleasant. Happy and enjoy, that's pleasure. However, it is usually used in negative sense a lot, especially for physical and instant pleasure.

쾌락에만 너무 빠져들면 안 된다.
It is not good to be indulged only in pleasures.

#  오락

오락(娛樂) is amusement or entertainment. 오 and 락 have the same meaning, having fun. Many old people call computer games as 오락. In addition, many variety programs are also called 오락 프로그램. As many of you know, they are also called 예능 프로그램.

오락 그만하고 공부 좀 해.
Stop playing games and study now!

#  낙관적(樂觀的)/낙천적(樂天的)

Both 낙관적 and 낙천적 are for the word, optimistic, but the usages are a little bit different. 낙관적 is usually used for the future of the situation like test results, the spread of disease, etc. It got this meaning because 관(觀) means to see something, so 낙관적 basically means to see the future pleasant.

그는 시험 결과를 낙관적으로 보고 있다.
He is optimistic for the test result.

낙천적 is usually used for the personality of a person. If a person is optimistic, he or she is 낙천적. 천 here means sky, heaven. There is a word called 천성(天性) in Korean. It is the personality given from heaven, or someone's nature. That's why 낙천적 is used for personality.

그 사람은 항상 낙천적이야.
He is always optimistic.

This is general rule, so you can find some people use 낙천적 for situation and 낙관적 for personality.

#  노래 악

The second sound for this character is 악. When it is used for music, it is read as 노래 악. The most famous example is 음악(音樂), music. 음(音) means sound, so 음악 basically means sound and song, that's music.

Let's see more examples. 악기(樂器) is musical instrument. 기 here means plate or bowl. It basically means that the bowl that can hold sound. Another example is 악보(樂譜) meaning score. 보 here means genealogy or family tree. Every musical notes are written in 악보 like every names in genealogy. You can guess why it got this meaning.

음악 시간을 좋아했지만, 노래는 잘 못 부른다.
I liked the music classes, but I am not good at singing.

악기 다루는 법을 배우고 싶다.
I want to learn how to handle musical instrument.

악보를 읽을 줄 모르면서 어떻게 그런 연주를 할 수 있지?
How can he play the music like that while he can't read scores.

If you are a fan of K-POP, you might have heard of 악동 뮤지션. 악동 in their name doesn't mean naughty kids as you might have guessed. 악 there is the same 악 we've learned just before. It means kid musicians that handle music. This name was firstly created by the younger sister, 이수현. Her brother, 이찬혁, thought that it is a bad name, because it reminds them of naughty or even evil kids. However, he started to like that name when their father told them 악 can be 즐길 락 rather than 악할 악(惡), so 악동 also means the kids that have fun with music. He agreed with his father and started to like that name. Thanks to the ambiguity of the character, they got their good name.

#  좋아할 요

Finally, it's 요. Actually, you can forget about it now. It is hard to find real usage. It would be useful if you are going to take 한자 tests, but in reality, it is rarely used. You can only find some examples from old books, so just forget it. It's not that important.
