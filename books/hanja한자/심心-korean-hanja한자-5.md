Heart is one of the synonyms of mind. As we all know, the word, heart, has 2 meanings. First of all, it is the physical heart in our body. It pumps blood without rest. The second meaning is abstract heart, it is the synonym of the word, mind. The character 심(心) is same. It sometimes means heart and mind. Then, let's see the examples of words that contain 심.

#  Heart, the Organ

심장(心臟) is our physical heart. 장 here means organ. Although the character 심 means our physical heart, it is not used alone to call our hearts. It is only used like 심장. When your heart suddenly stops, it is called heart attack in English. It is called 심장 마비 in Korean. 마비 here doesn't mean attack. It means paralysis.

As that old gentleman got the heart attack, they move him to the hospital quickly.

In some news, we can hear someone who helped heart-attacked people by CPR, cardiopulmonary resuscitation. It is called 심폐 소생술 in Korean. Cardio means heart and pulmonary means lung, so it is 심장과 폐 in Korean. It is shortened to 심폐. Resuscitate means to help breathe again. It is kind of reviving. That's why it is called 소생술.

If your body and soul are tired, it is good to just take some rest a bit and do it again.

#  Everything in Our Mind

심 is also used to call everything that happens in our minds.
의심(疑心) is doubt because 의 means doubt.
As 진 means true, 진심(眞心) is your true mind, so it means sincerity.
As 본 means base, 본심(本心) is the basic mind, so it means real intention.
