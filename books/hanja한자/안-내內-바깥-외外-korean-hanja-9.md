Do you know Mobius Strip? It is a strip that has no inside and outside. By twisting the strip once when connecting each end, its inside and outside are connected, so there is no in and out. It is used a lot in conveyor belts.

Mobius Strip is one of the rare exceptions that have no inside and outside, but most of our daily items have them. To say those concepts, 2 Hanja characters are used, 안 내(內) and 바깥 외(外).

Let's see them in more details.

#  시내/시외

City is 도시(都市) in Korean and many formal names of Korean cities end with 시 like 서울시, 인천시, 부산시. If something is inside city, then it is called 시내(市內). If it is outside of a town, it is 시외(市外).

시내버스 요금이 인상된다는데, 시외버스도 올라가겠지?
It is said that the fees for intra-city bus will be increased. Then, the fees of intercity buses will go up. Right?

#  국내/국외

When something happens in a nation, it is 국내(國內). If it happens outside nation, it is 국외(國外). When Koreans use the expression, nation(국) in 국내 or 국외 means Korea. Therefore, the original meaning of 국내 is inside the nation, but it means inside Korea in most cases. It is applied to 국외, too. Some of you thought that it is odd or unfair, but similar things are in English, too. NBA stands for National Basketball Association. NASA stands for National Aeronautics and Space Administration. National here means US, not the simple nation. It sounds natural to US people, but it is really unfair to UK or Australia.

국내에서 번 돈을 국외로 빼돌리던 일당이 검거되었다.
The gang were arrested who pocket the money to the foreign country which was earned in Korea.

#  교내/교외

School is 학교 in Korean. If something happens inside school, then it is 교내(校內). If it is outside school, it is 교외(校外).

교내 한 게시판에서 교외 행사에 참여할 학생을 모집한다는 말을 듣고 찾아왔어요.
I came here because I saw in a school bulletin that you were gathering students for after school events.

#  도심/교외

However, there is a same sound word, 교외(郊外) which has different meaning. It means suburb. 교 here means field. It is written in the dictionary that it is also used for traffic hub. I guess that 교외 became suburb because of this meaning. Suburbs are not the traffic hub. They are outside of traffic hub. The antonym of suburb 교외 is not 교내, it is 도심. 심 here means the same 심(心) we learned before. Its basic meaning is heart. I didn't tell you before, but this 심 sometimes means center.

요즘은 도심보다 교외에 위치한 상점들이 장사가 더 잘 된다고 한다.
Nowadays, the stores located in suburbs do better business than in the center of the city.
