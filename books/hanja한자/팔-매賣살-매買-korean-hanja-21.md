As we cannot make everything by ourselves, we buy and sell things a lot. The 2 characters 팔 매(賣) and 살 매(買) are used for selling and buying. These 2 characters have the same sound but opposite meaning. In addition, 2 characters look similar. When Koreans learn that character, teachers tell us that someone who sells should bring what they should sell, so there is something up in the character. Fortunately, these 2 characters are not used alone to tell selling or buying. If they were used like that, it might be hard for us to distinguish them.

#  판매(販賣)/구매(購買)

판매 means selling and 구매 means buying. 판 here also means selling and 구 here also means buying.

구매하려던 물건이 다 팔려서 못 샀어.
I couldn't buy that because it was sold out.

그분이 유튜브 방송에서 하는 게임을 보면 참 재미있는데, 직접 구매해서 해 보면 재미가 없더라고. 이상해.
When I see him playing games in YouTube, it is really interesting. However, it is not that interesting when I buy and play it. It is odd.

#  매장(賣場)/매표소(賣票所)

매장 means shop, store or department. This word is used when something is sold in there. 장 means field. You can guess that the meaning came from the field that sells something.

매표소 is the place that sells tickets. They are in front of the concert halls, amusement parks, museums.

매장 깊숙한 곳에 숨겨져 있어서 간신히 찾았다.
As it was hidden deeply inside the shop, I found it with great effort.

산 입구 매표소에서부터 정상까지 세 시간 정도 걸은 것 같다.
It seems that I walked about 3 hours from the ticket office to the top.

#  예매(豫買)

Sometime we reserve our tickers for the concert, movies or trains. These reserving tickets are called 예매 in Korean. Take note that it is not called 예약.

예 means in advance or early. It means buying something in advance, so it is reserve.

10분만에 예매가 끝났어.
The reservation was done in 10 minutes.

인터넷 예매가 전화 예매보다 편하더라.
Internet reservation is more convenient than telephone.
