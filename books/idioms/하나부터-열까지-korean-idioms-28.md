Everyone makes mistakes and there are always something wrong and right in a work or a project, but sometimes we find things that are entirely or completely wrong or right. In this case, Koreans use "하나부터 열까지" to describe this entirety or completeness.

As you all know, 하나 means one and 열 means ten. But Koreans use number ten to say complete, or many. For example, 십분 means 10 minutes or 10 parts but if you use it as an adverb, it means completely, entirely. "능력을 십분 활용하다" doesn't mean "you used your ability for 10 minutes," but "you used your ability to the limit." So, 하나부터 열까지 means basically "from one to ten." But in this case, it means from little to much, from the basic to the advanced or from the simple to the complicated, from the beginning to the end, or just completely or entirely.
