They say that it is less than 0.01% to win a lottery, but something that hard happens in reality and sometimes there are many winners.

To describe that low and tiny probability in Korean when you suppose somthing, the expression "만에 하나" is used.

만 here means 10,000 and 하나 means 1, so this expression means once in 10000 times. It is mathematically 0.01%. Almost impossible probability.

#  Examples

만에 하나 네가 다칠까봐 그런다.
I do this because it is possible that something can harm you.

만에 하나 그런 일이 일어난다면 내가 꼭 너를 지켜줄게.
If that really happens, I will protect you.

만에 하나 우리가 두려워하는 그 일이 벌어진다고 해도, 그 문제는 그 때 가서 생각하자.
It that thing we fear really happens, let's think about it at that time later.
