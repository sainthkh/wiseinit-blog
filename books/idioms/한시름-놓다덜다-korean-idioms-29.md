It would be great if we have nothing to worry, but we all know that it is impossible. It is really hard for us if we are almost dying from some anxiety. However, it feels really awesome, something that makes us worry is gone. This is called "한시름 놓다" or "한시름 덜다" in Korean.

한시름 is a word with 시름 with a prefix 한. 한 means big or grand. As an example, the old name of 대전, a city of Korea, was 한밭. 한 means big and 밭 means a farm. In Japanese Colonization Era, 한밭 changed into 대전, as 대(大) also means big and 전(田) means a farm as you can guess. Although the word, 한밭, is not widely used as a name for geographical location, but it is sometimes used for some brand. For example, there is a baseball team in 대전 called 한화 이글스, and their home stadium is called 한밭구장. 구장 here means baseball park.

시름 is not 싫음, or dislike or hatred. It means worry. It is not widely used as 걱정, but you can find it from time to time as 시름에 잠기다 or 시름에 빠지다, meaning deep in worry or anxiety.

So, 한시름을 놓다 basically means dropping down the big anxiety and 한시름을 덜다 is basically to take away some burden. Therefore, you can see them as "to be relieved of a burden" or "take some anxiety away from your mind."

#  Examples

집에 들어오지 않길래 걱정하고 있었는데, 방금 연락이 왔다. 이제는 한시름 놓아도 되겠다.
I was worrying because she didn't come back home, but she contacted me just before. It took away my burden.

사건이 해결되어서 한시름 덜었다 생각했는데, 다른 일이 터져 버렸다.
I thought I was relieved of a burden as the case closed, but another one started.

이제 네 눈도 다 나았으니, 한시름 놓고 빵 만드는 일에만 집중하거라.
Now that your eyes are cured, take away the anxiety from your mind and just focus on making breads.
