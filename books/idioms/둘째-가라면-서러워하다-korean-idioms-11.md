We always want to get the first place, not the second. It is really good if you are at the first place. But there are some sad situation that you were moved to the second from the first for some reasons. Then, you might feel sad or humiliated.

Today's expression "둘째 가라면 서러워하다" came from this feeling. 둘째 means second place, 서러워하다 means sad because of humiliation or unfairness. 둘째 가라면 here means "if someone makes you go to the second place." If we add them all up, "둘째 가라면 서러워하다" means "You will feel sad if someone makes you go to the second place." She was always the first, so it might be so harsh for her if she had to be the second.

Therefore, "둘째 가라면 서러워하다" means simply the best, second to none, or better than anybody.
