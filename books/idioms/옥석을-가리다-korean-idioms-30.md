When you recruit people, you want to test the applicants and find out the good and skillful from the bad and clumsy, because the resource is limited and we cannot hire everyone. Sometimes in English, this testing process is called "discriminating gems from pebbles." It is called "옥석을 가리다" in Korean.

옥석 is 옥 and 석. 옥 is jade, a kind of jewelry or gemstone. 석 is a stone, it means all kinds of stones, so 옥 is also a kind of 석. If we put them all together, 옥석 means jades and/or stones. 가리다 means pick up, evaluate, or discriminate. Therefore, 옥석을 가리다 means "taking jades from ordinary stones," and "discriminating gems(in this case, jades or 옥) from pebbles or ordinary stones or 석."
