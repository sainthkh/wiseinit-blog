Someone asks you something but that was asked before. What you said at that time is absolutely correct, so you don't want to say more about it. You want to make her sure what you told her was true. Then, you can use the expression "두말하면 잔소리" in Korean.

두말하다 means speaking twice and 잔소리 means nagging. 두말하면 잔소리 means "It becomes nagging if I tell you this once again," or "Hey, you don't want me to nag. If I tell you about it once more, it's like nagging to you, so don't ask me that again." In short, you can use "두말하면 잔소리" to say "it is absolutely sure," "it is really certain" something like that.

#  Examples

한국어를 잘 하려면 우선 한국어나 한국에 관심이 있어야 한다는 것은 두말하면 잔소리이다.
It is absolutely sure that you have interest in Korean or Korea to be good at Korean.

운동하고 씻지 않는 것이 얼마나 해로운지는 두말하면 잔소리이다.
It is certain how harmful it will be if you did exercise and didn't wash after that.

두말하면 잔소리이겠지만 한국어 공부는 내 인생에 정말 큰 도움이 되었어.
It is an unmovable fact that learning Korean helped me a lot in my life.

#  Final note to the expression

As you know, there are alternative expressions for saying "yes" like "absolutely," "certainly," "you can say that again," "tell me about it." You can use "두말하면 잔소리지" as an alternative for "예" or "그렇습니다."

Let's see an example.

철수: 한국어 공부 재미있어?
Paul: 두말하면 잔소리지.
철수: Do you like studying Korean?
Paul: You can say that again.
