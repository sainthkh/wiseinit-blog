If you want to drive in a nail with a hammer well, you should hit the top of its head. If you miss it, you cannot drive in your nails. From this situation, the expression "hit the nail on the head" came out. This is used when we want to describe the circumstances that you told the keypoint.

The similar expression in Korean is "정곡을 찌르다."

정곡 means the right middle of a target. 찌르다 means pierce, stab, or poke. Think about archery. The archer shot an arrow and it hit on the right middle of the target which is 정곡 in Korean. Like this, if your answer or talks are in the right way exactly, it is called "정곡을 찌르다" in Korean.
