If you are good at something, you can be proud of that. Today's expression "내로라하다" came out from this pride.

내로라 means "It's me." "내로라" is an old way of saying "나야" or "접니다" in Korean. "하다" here is used for indirect speech. To add them all up, "내로라하다" means "saying that it's me."

Suppose a situation that you are really good at something or you are really famous for something that you can speak proudly in front of a crowd like "it's me who did it" or "it's me who you are finding." This expression describes that situation, so it means "best of all," "the cream of the crop."

As you can see, "내로라하다" has the similar meaning with the expression "둘째 가라면 서러워하다" which we learned a few days ago.
