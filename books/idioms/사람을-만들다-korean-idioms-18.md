We are not alone. We are affected by and affect others. There are many good influences and others are bad.

To give someone a good influence and make him or her a better person is called "사람을 만든다" in Korean. 사람 is a person or a human, 만든다 is to make, so 사람을 만든다 means making a human.

It sounds like it has something to do with making a man from nothing as God did of the dust of the ground, but the origin of this expression has nothing to do with it.
