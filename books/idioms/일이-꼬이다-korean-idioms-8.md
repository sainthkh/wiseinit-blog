It would be really great if everything goes well, but it is our dream, not a reality. We meet a lot of obstacles when we are trying to do something. When the works we are doing don't go well, it is called "일이 꼬이다" in Korean.

꼬이다 means twisted. We want our steps to the success to be a wide and straight road, but some hard works are twisted like a spaghetti. Therefore, if some works don't go well, it is called 일이 꼬이다.

#  Examples

일이 왜 이렇게 꼬이는지 모르겠다.
I don't know why the works don't go well.

그 친구가 이쪽 전문가라길래 불러서 해결해 보려고 했는데, 일이 더 꼬여버렸다.
It is said that he is an expert in this field, so I called him to solve this problem out, but it became worse.

원래는 어제까지 끝내려 했는데, 일이 꼬이다 보니 언제 끝날 지 확신하기 어렵다.
At first, I wanted to finish that work yesterday, but it didn't go well, and I am not sure when it will be ended.
