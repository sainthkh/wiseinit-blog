If some people get along well with each other, we say that "they have really good chemistry" in English. In Korean, it is called "손발이 잘 맞다."

손 is a hand and 발 is a foot. When we do some work for something, we use our hands and feet. So if your team want to work well together, their hands and feet should be at proper places at proper times, so we call it "손 발이 잘 맞다."

The opposite of "손발이 잘 맞다" is "손발이 안 맞다"

#  Examples

쟤네 둘은 맨날 싸우는데, 프로젝트 할 때만 되면 그렇게 손 발이 잘 맞을 수 없다.
Those two always fight, but when they work in a project, they have a really great chemistry.

우리 왜 이렇게 손 발이 안 맞지?
Why do we have bad chemistry for this work?

MC들이 출연자들을 인터뷰하는데 손 발이 안 맞아서 무척 웃겼다.
It was really funny because hosts didn't work as a team when interviewing the guests.
