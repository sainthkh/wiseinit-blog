There are some cases or situations that someone wants to hide something such as from some objects like small jewelry, electronic applianes to her emotions like happiness, fun, sadness, frustration, etc. She tried to hide everything, but sometimes we feel or know that she is trying to hide something, and we can easily guess what she was trying to hide.

This is called "티가 나다" in Korean. 티 means attitude, 나다 means rise or show. 티가 나다 means " Seeing some odd attitude", or "it shows."
