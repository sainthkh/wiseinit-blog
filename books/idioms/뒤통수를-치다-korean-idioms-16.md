In many stories, there is at least one person who betrays the lead character, even though the lead character trusted him.

In this situation, what the traitor did is called "뒤통수를 쳤다" in Korean, and the main character is "뒤통수를 맞았다." 쳤다 is the past tense form of 치다, to hit and 맞았다 is the past tense form of 맞다, to get hit. 뒤통수 is the back of your head.

Think about this situation. You were walking along a street peacefully. All of a sudden, someone came out and hit the back of your head. You might feel really alarmed. When someone betrays you, it gives you a similar feeling. So, to betray is called "뒤통수를 치다" in Korean.
