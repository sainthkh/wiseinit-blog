* 간 떨어지다: really really startled.
* Because 간 here means the liver in your body, somebody was curious that the liver really drops(떨어지다) or moves when he or she is startled. It was tested in a TV show and there's no movement at all.
* So you don't have to worry about your liver when you are startled.




깜짝이야! 간 떨어지는 줄 알았네.
Ouch! It scared me off.

길을 가는데 갑자기 옆 건물 유리창이 깨졌다. 간 떨어지는 줄 알았다.
I was walking along the street and the glass is broken in the building next to me. I was really startled.

장난 좀 그만 쳐. 간 떨어지는 줄 알았잖아.
Stop kidding me. It scared me off.
