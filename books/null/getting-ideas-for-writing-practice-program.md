Hello,

Recently, I am trying to make Korean Writing Practice Program. It will be a paid program and I will try my best to set a reasonable price. 

It sounds like a big program, but it's simple. We will send emails to each other. 

* I'll send you a topic or prompt for the writing. 
* Then, you write about that in Korean and send me the writing. 
* I will analyze and correct your writing. In addition, I will send you another topic or prompt based on your writing. 
* You send me back your answer again. 
* Then, I correct it again to you.

We will do this for 3 weeks. 

To make this better, I want to get some ideas from you.

* Can you tell me what is the biggest challenge when writing in Korean? 
* Can you tell me what you did to solve that problem?(Optional)
