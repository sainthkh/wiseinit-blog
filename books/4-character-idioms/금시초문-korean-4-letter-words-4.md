We get tons of information these days, some of them are familiar, others are new to us. When we heard something totally new, we usually say, "it's new to me," "I've never heard of it," etc. in English. In Korean, you can say that "처음 듣는 이야기인데요," but we can also say that with the 4 letter word, "금시초문" like "금시초문인데요."
