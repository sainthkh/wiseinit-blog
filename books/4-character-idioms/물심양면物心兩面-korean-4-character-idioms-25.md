No one is perfect, so we get help from many other people. Most of them freely give us what we needed. On top of that, we can feel their kind hearts. These tangible and intangible things in help are called 물심양면 in Korean.

물 means object or tangible things. 심 means heart or mind. 양 means number 2 or both. 면 means side. 물심양면 basically means in both sides of tangible things like money, food and intangible things like warm and kind heart. This expression is used when you help somebody else because we should not only provide what they need but also we should do this sincerely or with kind heart. To sum up, it means helping others both emotionally and materially

#  Examples

철수는 병원에 있는 영희가 빨리 회복할 수 있도록 물심양면으로 도왔다.
철수 helped 영희 both emotionally and materially to recover fast.

물심양면으로 도와주지는 못할 망정 괴롭혀서야 되겠니?
I know that we cannot help him with our heart and money, but why are you hassling him?

우리 남매는 전쟁으로 부모님을 잃었지만 그분께서 우리 남매를 물심양면으로 잘 돌보아 주셔서 지금같이 성장할 수 있었다.
My sister and I lost our parents in the war, but he has taken care of us emotionally and materially, so we could grow up like now.
