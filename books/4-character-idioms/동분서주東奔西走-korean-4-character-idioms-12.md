All of us are busy at some point because of the works. Thanks to them, we sometimes have to run to here and there. 동분서주 is the right expression for this situation.

동분서주 is the emphasized version of the word, 분주하다, a synonym of 바쁘다 in Korean. 분 and 주 means to run. 동 means east, 서 means the opposite direction of 동, west. The basic meaning of 동분서주 is to run to the east and west. Think about this situation, something happened in the east, so you ran there to solve it. Not so long after it is finished, other thing occurred in the west, so you had to run there to check it out. You would be really busy if you were in such a situation. That's why 동분서주 got this meaning, being really busy.
