Farmers endure scorching hot summer to get the fruits in fall. Students study hard to get the result they want. Like these, we have to try our best to accomplish our goals. It is hard and sometimes makes us tired to put some effort on something, but we all know that the achievements are so sweet. For these efforts and consequences, we use the expression, "no pain, no gain" in English, and "고진감래" in Korean.

고 means bitterness. It is hard or painful to swallow up bitter medicine, so 고 usually means hardships. 진 means end. 감 means sweet and happy days in this expression. 래 means to come. 고진감래 means "after some hardships, happy days come".
