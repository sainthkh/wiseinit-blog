All of us have bad habits and sometimes those habits make us commit something really wrong. After that, we regret it and try not to do that again and do our best to live better. It is "turn over a new leaf" in English and "개과천선" in Korean.

개 means fix or reform. 과 means error, sin. 천 means practice, do, or follow. 선 means good. The basic meaning of 개과천선 means to fix the old sins and follow good. Therefore, 개과천선 means to turn over a new leaf.
