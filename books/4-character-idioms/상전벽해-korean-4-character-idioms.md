Sometimes the world around us changed a lot without telling us anything. We cannot believe our eyes when we see this.

상전벽해 is the word for this situation. 상전 means the forest or farm of mulberry trees, 벽해 means blue see. The basic meaning of 상전벽해 is the change from a forest to a blue sea. It is used to call such a drastic change.
