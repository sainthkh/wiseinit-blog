It is a rare case in our lives, but sometimes something good happens to us and something better happens again after it. 금상첨화 is the word for this best situation.

금 means silk, 상 means up or upon, 첨 means add, 화 means flowers. The basic meaning of 금상첨화 is adding flower on the silk. Silk is pretty and flowers are also pretty. By adding flowers on the silk, the silk becomes more beautiful. It is the case of making something good better. When something good happened and something good or better is added to it or happens after it, then you can use the word, "금상첨화."

We learned the word, 설상가상, to make matters worse, not long ago. 금상첨화 is the opposite word for 설상가상.
