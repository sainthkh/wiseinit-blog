Almost a month and a half has passed since the beginning of 2015. Do you still follow your new year's resolution? Some of you might do that, but I guess that most of you don't, I know that it is really hard to keep them. I usually do that, too. 작심삼일 is the word for us.

작 means make, 심 means mind, so 작심 means making up one's mind or decide. 삼일 means 3 days. The basic meaning of 작심삼일 is 3 days after the resolution. As I said before, it is really hard to keep that resolution for more than 3 days, so 작심삼일 is used to describe the quit after the resolution after a short period of time.

#  Examples

올해 초에는 꼭 운동을 열심히 하겠다고 결심을 했는데, 결국 작심삼일로 끝났다.
I made a resolution to work out hard in the beginning of this year, but I couldn't stick to it.

작심삼일이라는 말이 있죠? 그런데 결심하고 3일은 지키시나요? 사실 그것도 대단한 거에요. 다음날도 안 하는 사람들 많거든요.
It is said that you cannot stick to your resolution for 3 days. Then, do you keep that resolution for 3 days? Actually, it is a great achievement to keep it for only 3 days. Most of people don't keep it tomorrow.

작심삼일도 100번만 하면 한 해가 지나간다.
If you make resolutions after every 3 days, a whole year passes.
