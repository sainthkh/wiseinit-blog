When there is a big problem, we think deeply for a long time to solve it. Today's expression 심사숙고 can be used for this kind of deep consideration.

Some of you might know the word, 사고하다, as a synonym of the word, 생각하다, to think in Korean. 사 and 고 in 심사숙고 are the same 사 and 고 in 사고하다. In other words, both of them mean to think. 심 means deep. The basic meaning of 숙 is to cook or to master some fields. To cook a food or to master a subject, it takes a long time, so you can think of 숙 in this expression as long. Therefore, 심사숙고 is to think deeply for a long time.
