When something bad happens, it gives us a really hard time. Sometimes, to make matters worse, something worse happens after that and that gives us an even harder time.

To describe this sad situation in Korean, you can use the word, 설상가상. 설 means snow, first 상 means on or upon, 가 means add, last 상 means frost. Note that 설상가상 has two 상s, but they have different meaning. Because of the snow, it is cold now, but there also came frost, it makes us even colder. Frost makes the problems of snow worse, so 설상가상 means to make matters worse.
