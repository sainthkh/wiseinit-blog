We always meet some problems in our daily lives. Those problems sometimes make us think "I should have prepared it before." The very first 4 letter expression is for this situation. It is called "유비무환," meaning "If you are thoroughly prepared already, then you don't have to worry about it later."

This expression has a really long history. It goes back to Spring and Autumn Period of China. It started in 770 B.C. Duke Dao of Jin had a wise prime minister, Wei Jiang. He helped him make Jin the strongest nation in that period under his reign.

Wei Jiang said that "We should think dangers when we are in peace. Then, we are well prepared. If we are prepared, the anxieties will be gone." 유비무환 came from this part, "If you are prepared, the anxieties will be gone."

Examples
