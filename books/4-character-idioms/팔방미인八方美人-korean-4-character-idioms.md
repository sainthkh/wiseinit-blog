Although it is a rare case, but there are some people who are good at everything. It is hard to find some flaw from them. They are just perfect. The word, 팔방미인, can be used to call those people.

팔 means number 8, 방 means directions. 팔방 means 8 directions or all directions in figurative sense. 미 means beauty or beautiful. 인 means person. 팔방미인 basically indicates a person who is beautiful in every direction. In other words, it means the person who is perfect in everything.

It's a bit like Jack of all trades in English, but Jack is the master of none, but 팔방미인 is the master of all.
