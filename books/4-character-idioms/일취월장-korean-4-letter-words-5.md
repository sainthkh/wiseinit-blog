We always want our skills to improve. In some cases, we can find that out ourselves, in other cases, others tell us about that. As you learn Korean, you might have some experience about the improvement of your Korean skills.

If your skills improve daily and monthly or continually, it is called "일취월장" in Korean.

This expression came from the old poetry book in China called Classic of Poetry, or 시경 in Korean. The second king of Zhou Dynasty wrote a poem like this:

I am wretched and not at all clever.
My study will improve daily and monthly to the light, however.
So do your best to help me see your good deeds ever and ever.

As you can see in his poem, we can feel his modesty and willingness to learn. As a result, he really became a good king and it is said that he opened the golden age of Zhou Dynasty.

I studied Korean continuously in last winter vacation, so I didn't have any problem when I was talking with a Korean. I can say that my Korean got better a lot.
