In the war history, there are some castles or fortresses that were hardly or even never fallen. They have strong walls and get some benefits from the nature. These strong architectures are called 난공불락 in Korean.

난(難) means hard, 공(攻) means attack. 불(不) means not or no, 락(落) means fall or collapse. 난공불락 means it is hard to attack that castle and that castle never collapses. However, it is not only used to call just some buildings, but it is also used figuratively to call some companies or even people if they are so strong that they are almost invincible.
