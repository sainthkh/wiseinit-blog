There are some people in the world that predict something accurately. We firstly thought that it is a nonsense, but the world becomes like what they once said. We are amazed by their foresight in English or 선견지명 in Korean.

선 means first or early. 견 means see or look. 지 means to know. 명 means bright or clear. The basic meaning of 선견지명 is to look earlier and know something clearly. Simply, it is foresight.

#  Examples

3년 후 유가가 그 당시 가격의 절반으로 떨어질 것이라고 그가 예측을 했을 때 다들 무시했는데, 그 말대로 되었다. 모두가 그의 선견지명에 놀라는 중이다.
When he predicted that the oil price will cut in half 3 years later, everyone ignored him, but it became true. They are amazed by his foresight.

다들 내 선견지명에 놀랐다고 하지만, 나는 그냥 과거와 현재를 살펴보고 이야기한 것 뿐이다.
Everyone says that they are amazed by my foresight, but I told that to them after I looked the past and the present.

마치 이렇게 될 것을 처음부터 알았던 것처럼 모든 것을 준비한 그의 놀라운 선견지명 덕택에 그 난리 속에서도 살아남을 수 있었다.
I could survive in the disaster thanks to his amazing foresight. He prepared everything as if he knew all of them were going to happen like this at first.
