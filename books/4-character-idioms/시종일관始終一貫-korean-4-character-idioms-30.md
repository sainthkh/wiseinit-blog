It is hard to be constant. We always change even though we try hard not to. 시종일관 is the word for that hard practice, being the same from the beginning to the end.

시 means start, 종 means end, 일 means one, 관 means pierce. The basic meaning of 시종일관 is to pierce in one way from the beginning to the end. Think about a straight line which is parallel from start to end. That line is constant. If your emotion, opinion, or idea is constant like that line, it is 시종일관.
