Let's say you are a general of a troop, and you are guarding a castle. One day, the enemy came to kill you with a great number of army. You might be out of your mind. However, the government knew the attack and they sent you a big army to support you. 천군만마 is the word for this big army.

천 means a thousand, 군 means soldiers, 만 means ten thousand, 마 means horse. The basic meaning of 천군만마 is a big army. Like many 4 character idioms, its basic meaning is not widely used. Koreans only use 천군만마 figuratively to describe a great help, a fantastic support when you were in a great danger.

Some of you might have noticed that there are only a thousand soldiers but there are 10 thousand horses, 10 horses for a person. It looks like a waste of horses. Actually, 군 sometimes mean a troop of army, so 천군만마 also means that a thousand troops and 10,000 horses. Then, it sounds more natural. I told you 군 as soldier earlier because every resource I have explains it like that, so I followed the suit.
