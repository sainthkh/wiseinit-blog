Some said that my situation now is the result of my choices in the past. If we did something good, it comes back to us. If we chose something bad, some disasters will be back.

Today's expression, 자업자득, is the expression for this situation. Two 자s in this expression means self, 업 means work and 득 means get, so it means you get what you worked or you will reap what you saw.

The important thing about this expression is that it is only used in negative sense. It is never used for positive cases. Let's say some scoundrel plotted a fraud but it somewhat failed and backfired to him. Then, it is called 자업자득. However, you entered Harvard because you studied hard, it is not 자업자득.
