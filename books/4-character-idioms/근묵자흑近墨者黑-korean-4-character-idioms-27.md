It is easier for us to get bad habits than good ones. If we get along with some bad friends, it will make us get some bad habits faster. The word, 근묵자흑, warns us not to do so.

근 means near. 묵 means ink stick. 자 means person. 흑 means black or dark. The basic meaning of 근묵자흑 is that "the person near the ink will become black." The color black here is used figuratively for crime or wrong deeds. If you are close to bad friends, it is likely that you will become bad like them. It is a warning for that undesirable result.
