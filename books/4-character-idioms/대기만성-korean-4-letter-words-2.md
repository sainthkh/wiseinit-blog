We all know at least one or two people who overcame their long hardship and became victorious at last. Actually, almost every successful person has a similar story.

Today's expression "대기만성" can be used to describe these people. The basic meaning of 대기만성 is "it takes long time to make a big plate." This expression wants to say that magnificent and successful people are not made quickly like big plates. As we say "rome wasn't built in a day" in English, successful people are not made in a day, too.

This expression was first told by Laozi to describe how hard it is to understand and follow tao. His original intention in speaking "long time to make a big plate" was "it is almost impossible." However, a few hundreds of years later, in 3 Kingdoms Period, Cui Yan had a younger cousin who didn't do well in anything and didn't have a decent job. So everyone looked down on him, but Cui Yan saw his potential and told him, "Big bells or big pots are not made easily. It takes long time for good people to be successful. Don't be discouraged and try hard. You will surely success." He really followed his advice and became one of the 3 secretaries of the emperor later. From then, 대기만성 got the meaning of "late success."
