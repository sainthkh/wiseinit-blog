It is hard to start a new work, but once we start it, it is usually quick and easy to end it. 일사천리 is the word for this quickness.

일 means one or once. 사 means pour or flow. 천리 means one thousand 리. 리 is an old measurement unit of the distance, 1 리 is 0.4 km or about one fourth miles, so the exact distance of 천리 is 400 km or 250 miles. However, in this word, 천리 is used in figurative sense, meaning long distance. Therefore, the basic meaning of 일사천리 is once it starts to flow, it goes a long way. Like this water, we can use this word to describe the fast progress of works.
