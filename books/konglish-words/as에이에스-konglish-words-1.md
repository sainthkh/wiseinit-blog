Every digital device has its own guarantee. In Korean, it is not called as 개런티 for guarantees or 워런티 for warranties. It is called A/S. It is not a conjunction "as." It is usually written as A/S(capital A slash(/) capital S). It stands for After Service.

This service includes installation of the product, repairs and checkups. These services are provided after the product is sold, so it is called After Service or A/S. The longer form 애프터서비스 is not used a lot, it is usually used as short form A/S and pronounced like 에이에스.

It is used like A/S 기간(guarantee period), A/S 지원(warranty support), A/S 비용(repair or checkup cost), A/S 처리(repair or fix something with the repair service), etc.
