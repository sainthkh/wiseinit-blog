In formal places, men wear suits. Under the jacket, they wear dress shirt. They are called 와이셔츠 in Korean. When we write T-shirts, there is alphabet T, so I first thought 와이 in 와이셔츠 was alphabet Y. After I read the word in dictionary, I found out that it was not Y, but it was short form of white.

I was once wondered how to say 구두 in English, and I was startled it was still shoes. In Korean, 신발 is broader term of shoes and 구두 call the shoes you where with your suit. We usually say that "양복을 입고, 구두를 신었다" not "양복을 입고, 신발을 신었다" meaning "After wearing the suit, I wore shoes."

와이셔츠 related phrases are 와이셔츠 세탁(the laundry of dress shirts), 와이셔츠를 다리다(ironing dress shirts), etc.
