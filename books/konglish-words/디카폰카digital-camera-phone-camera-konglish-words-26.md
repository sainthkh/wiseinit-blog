A few years ago, many of us used digital cameras. As they can take more pictures than film cameras and it is easier to send the pictures to PC, they were really popular. However, phones have great cameras these days, so many of us don't buy digital cameras and use phone cameras and we can get the photo we want. In English, they are called digital camera and phone camera, but they are called 디카 and 폰카 in Korean. As 디지털 카메라 is too long, so we took out first characters, 디 and 카, from each word and it became 디카. 폰카 is the same, it got its 폰 from 핸드폰(Konglish word for cell phone) or 스마트폰 and 카 from 카메라.

The old good film cameras are called 필름 카메라. Heavy but good DSLRs are called DSLR in Korean, too, but many people read it as 디세랄 or 데세랄. It is just because it is a bit shorter than 디에스엘알. The lens of cameras are same. They are called 렌즈 in Korean, too. The photographers are called 사진사, 사진기사 or 사진작가 in Korean. However, 사진작가s usually take pictures as art and 사진사 and 사진기사 just take pictures and make money by taking them.

디카 and 폰카 related words are 디카로 찍다(taking pictures with digital camera), 디카 인화(making a print of photo in digital camera), 디카 추천(digital camera recommendation), etc.

그래도 사진을 제대로 찍으려면 디카가 아직 폰카보다 나아.
Still, digital cameras are still better than phone cameras if you want to take good photos.
