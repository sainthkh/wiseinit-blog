The tests should be fair and square. However, some people try to cheat to get some better result. It is called cheating in English, but only English teachers use the word, cheating, in Korea. Many people call it 컨닝. 컨닝 came from the English word cunning meaning to achieve something by deceiving. In English, it has nothing to do with tests, but you have to be cunning to cheat. I guess that is the reason why 컨닝 became cheating in Korean.

컨닝 is used a lot in daily conversations. In newspapers or written Korean, it is usually written as 부정 행위. 부정 means wrong, illegal, corrupted and 행위 means action, deed. The basic meaning of 부정 행위 is doing something wrong or illegal. Almost every wrong action is related with cheating in test sites. That is why it is called 부정 행위 in Korean.

컨닝 related words are 컨닝 페이퍼(the paper for cheating), 컨닝하다가 걸리다(being caught for cheating), etc.

#  Examples

컨닝하지 마라. 시험은 시력으로 보는 것이 아니라 실력으로 보는 것이다.
Don't cheat. You should test with your abilities, not with your eyesight.

Although I taught you this word because it is a Konglish word, I know that you won't do cheating. Tests can indicate your current state and it can guide your next step to mastery, so please use them well.
