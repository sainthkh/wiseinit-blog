What is in your mind if you heard the word, pension? It might be money-related words like notes or bills from your company, etc. It might not be a house or travel. However, many Koreans think small houses for stay in tourist attractions if they hear the word, 펜션. 펜션s are usually small houses in Korea that is used for travelers to stay for a night or two.

I researched why 펜션 got its meaning. I think the word came from French. The word pension is used for houses in French. Its first meaning is about the money which is the same with English and the second meaning is the small house.

The pension you get your money after you retired is called 연금 in Korean. In Korea, the government runs a pension system and it is called 국민연금. It is really rare to hear 펜션 as 연금 in Korea.

펜션 related words are 펜션에 머물다(staying in a small hotel), 펜션을 예약하다(reserving a room in a small hotel), 펜션을 빌리다(borrowing the small hotel), etc.
