When we go out, we wear something good-looking, but we don't in our houses. We wear something comfortable at home. In Korea, many people wear 추리닝 in their houses.

Some of you might have wondered what 추리닝 is. It came from the word, training. Every athlete trains hard to win the game. Because of that, what they wear is called 트레이닝복 or 운동복. 트레이닝 became 추리닝 and 복 which came from the word, 의복, clothing, is eliminated from the word. That's how 트레이닝복 became a 추리닝.

It is also written like 츄리닝 with 유 not 우, but only 추리닝 is written in dictionary and it recommends to use 연습복 or 운동복.

추리닝-related words are 추리닝을 입다(wearing a sportswear), 추리닝 추천(recommending a sportswear), 단체 추리닝(the sportswear of an organization like school or organization), etc.
