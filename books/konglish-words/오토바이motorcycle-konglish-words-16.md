In many movies, main characters love motorcycles. I don't know why, but maybe it looks cool. It is called motorcycle, or just bike in English. Many Koreans also use that word as 모터사이클 or 바이크. However, many people call it 오토바이. Dictionary says that it came from the word, auto bike.

As Korea is a small nation and half of the population lives near Seoul, you can deliver something quick with 오토바이s if you want to. This is called 퀵서비스. As you can guess, it came from English expression, quick service, but I guess this is another Konglish word.

오토바이 related words are 오토바이 헬멧(motorcycle helmet), 중고 오토바이(secondhanded motorcycle), 오토바이 면허(motorcycle license), etc.
