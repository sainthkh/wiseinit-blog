There are many buttons on evert machine, but it is sometimes really tiresome to stand up from our seats and walk to the machine and press it. Because of that, we use a lot of remote controls. In English, we usually call them remotes as remote control is a bit long. In Korean, they are called 리모컨. Like 에어컨 which got its 컨 from conditioner, 리모컨 got its 컨 from control.

Sometimes it is written like 리모콘, but it is not standard. In dictionary, 리모컨 should not be used and we should use 원격 조정기 instead, but it is not used in daily conversation and it is even hard to find blog posts and news articles that say 원격 조정기 as 리모컨. Some writings which contain 원격 조정기 are some theses.

We are talking about remotes, so let's learn more words on remote controls. First of all, the power button is called 전원 버튼. Channels are called 채널, volume is called 음향. In some remotes, you can control the settings of the machine, it is called 설정. Sometimes people just call it 옵션. As you can guess, it is from the English word, option.
