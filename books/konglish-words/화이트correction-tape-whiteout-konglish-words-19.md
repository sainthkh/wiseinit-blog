If we made mistake when we were writing something with pencils, we can erase them with erasers. However, there is no eraser for pens and we should correct them with whiteout or correction tapes. They are called 화이트 in Korean. 화이트 can indicate whether it is liquid or tape. If you attend school in Korean, many students will ask you "화이트 있어?" If you have correction tape or whiteout, then answer them, "있어." If not, "없어."

If you search 화이트 in Korean online markets, it is hard to find what you want. All you can find is white boards(화이트보드). If you want to buy them online, search them as 수정액 or 수정 테이프. 수정 means correction and 액 means liquid. You can find them immediately.

In 수능, college entrance exam of Korea, they can bring their own 수정 테이프 with them. You can use them to correct your answers, but you cannot use 수정액 on answer sheets.

화이트 related words are 화이트로 지우다(erase with whiteout), 화이트가 망가지다(correction tape became out of order), etc.
