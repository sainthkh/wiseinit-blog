Like last episode, we will learn car Konglish words. I said there were 9 words, but I found more words after researching this topic. That's why we will cover 4 more words today and we will finish this topic tomorrow. Today's words are 펑크, 본네트, 백미러, 사이드미러.

#  펑크

펑크 came from the word, puncture. If you are familiar with British English, then you know that this word means the hole in the tire(actually, tire is written as tyre in British English). In American English, it is called flat tire. It is a little bit easy to guess puncture from the word, 펑크, but how about 빵꾸? 빵꾸 came from the word, 펑크. You can hear that some Koreans speak like 빵꾸 났다 meaning to get a puncture.

길 가던 도중 타이어에 펑크가 나서 잠시 길 옆에 차를 세워 두었다.
When we were on the road, a tire became flat that we had to pull over to the side of the road.

결승선 10m 전에서 펑크가 나서 우승을 놓쳤다.
We couldn't win the game because there was a puncture before the 10m of the finish line.

#  본네트

본네트 came from the English word, bonnet. It also came from British English, it means hood in American English. Some of you might have wondered many Konglish words in cars came from British English, but that is not always true. In Korean, many people call trunk where you put your luggage in as 트렁크, not a boot which is a British English word. It is hard to find rule, you should just memorize them.

옆집 아저씨께서 우리 차의 본네트를 열고 배터리에 전선을 연결해 문제를 해결해 주셨다.
The uncle next door opened the hood and connected the wire to our battery and solved the problem.

차가 이상해서 본네트를 열어 보니 불쾌한 냄새가 났다.
As the car is strange and I opened the hood, the nasty odor came out.

#  백미러

In UK, Japan, Australia, the driver's seat is on the right, then where is it in Korea? Like many other countries, it is on the left. The driver's seat is called 운전석 in Korean. The second seat next to 운전석 is called passenger seat in English and 조수석 in Korean. The rear-view mirror which is in between 운전석 and 조수석 is called 백미러 in Korean.

백미러에 보이는 저 차량, 아무래도 우리를 미행하는 것 같은데?
The car in the rear-view mirror. It seems that it tails us.

안전 운행을 위해서는 백미러를 자주 확인해야 해.
For safe driving, we should check rear-view mirror frequently.

#  사이드 미러

In cars, there are two mirrors on the side. They are usually called side-view mirror in English and it is called 사이드 미러 in Korean. As I researched the word in Wikipedia, it is also called wing mirror, door mirror, fend mirror or outside mirror. In Korean, it is only 사이드 미러. I once learned that it is not called side mirror in English, but googled it and there were some usage of side mirrors.

옛날에는 사이드 미러가 접히지 않았는데, 요즘 나오는 차들은 다 접히더라.
The side-view mirrors couldn't be folded before, but they are folded in recent cars.

사이드 미러가 없는 차를 만들었는데, 규제 때문에 생산을 못한다더라.
Someone made cars without side-view mirrors, but it cannot be produced because of the regulation.
