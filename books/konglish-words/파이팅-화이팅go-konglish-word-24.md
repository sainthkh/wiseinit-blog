In sports games, there are many supporters. They shout and sing for athletes on the ground to do well on the game. In English, supporters shout "Go" when they cheer for someone. Koreans don't use that word when they root for someone. The word, 파이팅 or 화이팅 is used in that case. As it is impossible to write f sound in Korean, both of them are possible, but 파이팅 is the standard in written Korean. But I think 화이팅 is more widely used in spoken Korean.

It is not clear where this word came from. In[ an article](https://www.yangsanilbo.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=29352), the origin of this word came from World War II. The soldiers who participated in kamikaze(suicide attack) operation shouted ファイト(화이또) before the start. That is the first time the word was used and it is changed for cheering purposes.

Other words used for cheer are 아자, 힘내라 or 힘내자. 응원가 is the song used in cheering.
