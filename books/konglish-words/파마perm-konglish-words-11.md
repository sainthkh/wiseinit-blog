There are so many hair styles in the world. Perm is one of them. In English, it is a shortened form of permanent wave. English took first four letters while Koreans took first 5 letters from the word and call it 파마.

To do a perm, you should visit hair shop(미용실) and many hair dressers(미용사) manage your hair.

We are talking about hair styles, so let's talk more about hair . First of all, straight hair is called 생머리. Actually, this is a bit strange word, because its original meaning is natural hair. Some people have natural waves or curl hairs. It is their 생머리 but it is not 생머리 in Korean. Almost every Korean has straight hair, so many people think straight hair is natural. I think that's why 생머리 got this meaning.

Natural curly hair is called 곱슬머리. If curliness is not prominent, but there is some curling, then it is called 반곱슬. 반 means half and 반곱슬 means in the half between 생머리 and 곱슬머리. If you braid your hair, it is called 머리를 땋다 or 땋은 머리 in Korean. Ponytail is called 포니테일 or 뒤로 묶은 머리 and twin tail is called 트윈테일 or 양 갈래로 묶은 머리.

파마 related phrases are 파마를 하다(do the perm), 파마 머리(perm hair style), 파마가 망하다(horrible or terrible perm), 파마를 풀다(undo or remove a perm), 스트레이트 파마(straight perm), etc.
