There are so many types of shows on TV. There are varieties, movies, TV series, documentaries, you name it. Almost every channel provides more than one TV series. As it is a series of stories, it is called TV series in English. Koreans call them 드라마. If it is made in Korea, then it is just called 드라마. However, they are called 미드 if they are made in US(미국), 중드 if made in China(중국), 일드 if made in Japan(일본), 영드 if made in UK(영국).

Many TV series in Korea has 20 episodes. It is called 20부작. 부 here indicates one episode in the series. However, Koreans prefer to call a single episode, 화. The first episode is 1화, the second one is 2화, the third one is 3화, on and on. Sometimes, there are really long series. 대추나무 사랑 걸렸네 has 852 episodes and it took 17 years to air them. The longest one was 전원일기. It has 1088 episodes and it had been on air for 22 years. Both of them talked about the life in rural area.

In many TV series of US or UK, they have multiple seasons, but it is really rare in Korea. They are almost always a single season. In some cases, they make a new series with number 2 next to existing title, but all actors are changed and story has little relativity. That's why many people want some TV series with multiple seasons(시즌제 드라마) like US or UK, but you can hardly find one.

미드 related words are 미드를 보다 or 미드를 시청하다(watching US TV series), 미드 자막(subtitle of US TV series), 미드 촬영지(the filming site of the US TV series), etc.
