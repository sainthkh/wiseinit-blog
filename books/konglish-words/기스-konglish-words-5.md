When some pointy thing stroked over something, it leaves a scratch. It is called scratch in English, but many Koreans call it 기스.

As 기스 and scratch sound really different, I was curious about its origin. The Korean dictionary told me that it came from Japanese. It is kiju(きず). It means scratch or wound. Sadly, Korea was once a colony of Japan, there are many words in Korean that came from Japanese and 기스 was one of them.

기스 is not the only word for the scratches. Some people use the word, 긁힘. 긁다 is to scratch and 긁히다 is to be scratched. 긁힘 is the noun form of 긁히다. Other people call it 스크래치. It is used a lot in news. Actually, you cannot find 기스 in news but there are a lot of blog posts that contain the word, 기스.

기스 related words are 기스 지우는 법(how to erase scratch), 기스가 나다(to be scratched), 기스를 내다(to make a scratch) and so on.
