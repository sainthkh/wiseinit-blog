When I am recording this podcast, it's April. Summer is coming soon. In summer, we use air conditioners a lot. In Korea, air conditioners are called 에어컨. 컨 is the shortened form of the word, conditioner. 에어 컨디셔너 is six syllable and you can cut it half by getting rid of 디셔너, so Koreans call it 에어컨.

In English, air conditioning sometimes indicates cooling down and heating up, but the Konglish word, 에어컨, is not used for heating up by itself. the machine that both support cooling and heating is called 냉난방기 or 냉난방 에어컨. You should state 냉난방 clearly. 냉방 means cooling and 난방 means heating. That's why 냉난방 got its meaning, 냉난방. If it only supports heating up, then it is called 온풍기, or 히터. Some people pronounce 히터 like 히타. As you can guess, 히터 came from the English word, heater.

When you walk around the streets of Korea in summer, you can see the word "냉방중." It means "air conditioner is on."

#  Examples

에어컨을 하나 사야하는데 뭘 사야할지 모르겠다.
I should buy an air conditioner, but I cannot decide what to buy.

이 방 냉난방 되지요?
Does this room support air conditioning?

한여름에 에어컨이 고장나다니.
Oh, no. My air conditioner is broken in the middle of summer.

I found out recently that some people say air conditioner as aircon in English. Although it is written in Wikipedia, it seems that aircon is less commonly used than air conditioner.
