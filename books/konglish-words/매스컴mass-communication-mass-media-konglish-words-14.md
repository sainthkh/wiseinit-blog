We cannot live without mass media. Actually, there are always with us, so we cannot be away from them. They are called mass media or shortly media in English, but they are called 매스컴 in Korean. It came from the word, mass communication. Like other Konglish words, it got its 컴 from 커뮤니케이션 because 컴 is a lot shorter than 커뮤니케이션.

In Wikipedia, it says that newspaper, magazine, book publishing, radio, television, film can work as mass communication. Newspaper is 신문 in Korean, magazine is 잡지, book publishing is 출판, radio is 라디오, television is 텔레비전, or we use the word TV, too. Some people use Japanese-like word, 테레비. Film is 영화 in Korean. If something becomes hot topic in the media, it is called hot issue, or hot potato. Koreans call it 핫 이슈, 핫 토픽 or 뜨거운 감자. As you can guess, 뜨거운 감자 is word by word translation of hot potato.

매스컴 related expressions are 매스컴을 타다(receiving some publicity from the media), 매스컴을 통해(through the media), 매스컴에 고발(report something to the media), 매스컴 노출, 매스컴에 나오다(showing up in the media), etc.
