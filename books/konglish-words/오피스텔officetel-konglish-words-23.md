Like 빌라, 아파트, 원룸, there are many Konglish words that are related with houses. 오피스텔 is one of them, too. It is the combination of office and hotel. This word indicates buildings that have rooms for dwelling and office for work in a single building. In the law about construction, 오피스텔s should have less than 50% of the residential rooms and more than 50% of offices. In short, the building should have more offices than rooms.

In 오피스텔s, many professional workers like tax accountants(세무사), professors(교수), painters(화가) live there. They prefer 오피스텔s because they usually work at home.

오피스텔 related phrases are 오피스텔 분양(selling officetel building in lots), 오피스텔로 이사하다(moving to officetel), etc.
