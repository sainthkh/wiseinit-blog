We spend a lot of times on cultural products like books, music, TV series and so on. Most of them are forgotten after a few years. However, some of them survived after the long period of time and are loved by many people. These are called classics. In Korean, these are called 고전.

Particularly, Koreans call classical music as 클래식. Although classics in English can indicate other than music like books, movies, etc., Konglish word 클래식 cannot do that. It is only used for music. If you want to call classical books, then you should call them simply 고전 or 고전 서적. The classical movies are called 고전 영화 and classical games are called 고전 게임, etc. You should add 고전 in front of the product. Because of these products, some people like to call 클래식 as 고전 음악.

클래식 related expressions are 클래식을 듣다(listening to classical music), 클래식 음반(classic album) and so on.

If you enter 클래식 into the green box of Naver, you can find some words that contain 클래식. These are usually used in names like cars or sports league. These are not related with music and just the part of the names.
