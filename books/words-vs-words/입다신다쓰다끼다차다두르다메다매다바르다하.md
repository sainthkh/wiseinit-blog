When learning a new language, we sometimes think something like this: "Why do they separate these words? It's too complex!" Wear verbs in Korean are common example for this. I prepared 10 verbs about wearing.

#  입다

입다 is for the clothing that covers the main part of your body. The verb, 입다, is for shirts(셔츠), dress shirts(와이셔츠), pants(바지), skirts(치마), suits(양복), underwear(속옷) etc.

IT 업계 사람들은 양복을 잘 안 입는다.
The people in IT fields usually don't wear suits.

어떤 학교들은 여학생들이 겨울에는 바지를 입는 것을 허락해 주기도 한다.
Some schools allow their female students to wear pants in winter.

#  신다

신다 is related to your feet. You can use 신다 with shoes(신발, 구두), socks(양말), snickers(운동화), high heels(하이힐), etc.

신으실 양말도 준비해 왔어야 했는데, 깜빡 했네요.
I should have prepared the socks for you to wear. It just slipped my mind.

방송 때야 하이힐을 신지만, 평소에는 운동화 신어요.
I wear high heels in films, but I usually wear snickers.

#  쓰다

When you cover your head with some clothes, it is called 쓰다 in Korean. 쓰다 is used with hats and caps(모자), or masks(가면). You can also use 쓰다 with Glasses(안경), too.

우리가 TV에서 연예인을 자주 보니까 실제로 보면 잘 알아볼 것 같은데 모자만 써도 못 알아 보는 경우도 많아.
As we see actors on TV a lot, it might be easy for us to recognize them when we meet them in person. In reality, we hardly recognize them if they only wear hats.

스파이더맨은 쓰고 있던 가면을 벗었다.
Spider-Man took off the mask he was wearing.

#  끼다

끼다 is used with glasses(안경) and contact lenses(콘택트 렌즈, 렌즈). In addition, it is used with something you wear in your hands like gloves(장갑), rings(반지). You can also use 끼다 with ear rings(귀걸이).

초등학교 4학년 때부터 안경을 꼈고요, 렌즈는 한 번도 안 껴봤어요.
I have put on glasses since my 4th grade in elementary school, and I have never put on contacts in my life.

추운데 장갑 좀 끼고 나오지.
You should have put on some gloves. It's too cold.

#  차다

차다 is used on your wrist or ankle. The examples of 차다 are bracelet(팔찌), and wrist watches(손목 시계).

평소에는 안 차던 시계를 왜 차고 있지?
Why is he wearing a watch? He usually doesn't do that.

여자친구에게 팔찌를 선물 받기는 했는데 갑갑해서 자주 안 찬다.
My girlfriend gave me a bracelet as a gift, but I don't wear it a lot because it is uncomfortable.

#  두르다

두르다 is for long and wide clothes like cloaks(망토), apron(앞치마), scarf, muffler(목도리), etc.

영웅들만 망토를 두를 수 있고, 영웅의 조수들은 망토를 두르지 못한다.
Only heroes can wear cloaks, and sidekicks of the heroes cannot wear them.

그녀는 앞치마를 두르고 요리를 하기 시작했다.
She wore an apron and started to cook.

#  메다

메다 is used with your bags. If you want to use the word, wear, with your bags, it should be attached to your body. So, the bags like backpack or long-strap ones are used with 메다. The verb, 들다, is used for other bags that you have to carry with your hands like handbags and suitcases.

개인적으로 메는 가방을 드는 가방보다 좋아하는데 잃어버릴 염려가 없기 때문이다.
I personally prefer the bags to wear on my shoulders than carrying ones because it is hard to lose them.

집에 오는 길에 가방을 하나 사서 메고 왔다.
I bought a bag and wore it on my way back home.

#  매다

매다 is used with neck ties and bow ties. If you listen to the podcast only, you might have wondered "Is 매다 again?" This 매다 is 매다, not 메다. 메다 is for backs and 매다 is for your neck.

넥타이 매는 법을 잊어버렸네. 검색해 봐야겠다.
I forgot how to wear the neck tie. I should search it.

그 아이가 항상 매고 다니는 나비 넥타이 뒤에는 비밀이 숨겨져 있다.
There's a secret on the behind of the bow tie that boy always wears.

#  바르다

When I learned that the verb, wear, is used with cosmetics, it was a small shock to me. I have never thought that native speakers of English would use something else for their cosmetics, but they didn't. My English teacher in my high school once told me, "몸에 붙이면 다 wear야(If something is attached to your body, then it is wear)," and cosmetics were her example.

화장품을 발라 보니 확실히 차이가 느껴진다.
I can surely feel the difference after I put on the cosmetics.

바빠서 로션만 바르고 나왔어.
I just came out after putting on only lotion, because I am busy.

#  붙이다

When you wear some artificial cosmetic products like 인조 손톱(fake nails, artificial nails), or 인조 속눈썹(artificial/fake/false eyelashes), the word 붙이다(paste, glue, attach) is used.

손톱이 별로 안 예뻐서 붙이고 나왔어요.
As my nails are not pretty, I put on some fake ones and came out.

너 속눈썹 잘못 붙인 것 같다.
It seems that you applied eyelashes wrong.

#  하다

This is our 11th and final verb, 하다. 하다 has simple meaning, do, but the do can be everything we are doing and wearing is part of it. Koreans use 하다 with artificial eyelashes(인조 속눈썹), earring(귀걸이), etc.

왜 집에서까지 속눈썹을 하고 있어? 불편하지 않아?
Why are you still wearing eyelashes in your home? Isn't it uncomfortable?

다시는 귀걸이 하지 말아야지.
I will never wear earrings again.

하다 is also used with cosmetics like 화장하다 or 화장을 하다, so we can change 바르다 with 하다 in our previous examples. Although it is possible to use 하다 with cosmetics, 바르다 is more commonly used.
