When we use the word review, we view something again. For example, we review our plans to do some work; or we review the product we used; or we review what we have learned. In all cases, we check or view what we once did and do some more or other things. However, in Korean, different words are used for each case. Let's learn about them one by one.

#  검토

When finishing the first draft of some <strong>plan, idea, reasoning, law</strong>, etc., they should be<strong> checked and analyzed</strong>. In this process, we try to find unexpected errors or holes in them. In this situation, 검토 is used.

조사 결과를 검토한 후 발표할 예정이다.
The investigation result will be announced after the review.

2016년에 시행할 프로젝트 계획을 검토 중이다.
The plan for the project in 2016 is under review.

#  후기/서평

After using some <strong>products</strong>, we leave reviews on blogs or online stores. It is usually called (사용) 후기 in Korean. 사용 in front of 후기 is optional.

후기에는 꼭 좋은 말만 쓸 필요는 없어.
You don't have to write only good words for reviews.

When it comes to books, the word, 서평, is also used. However, you can also use 후기 for book reviews.

이번 달에 서평을 10권 넘게 썼다.
I've written reviews of more than 10 books this month.

#  복습

<strong>After learning something</strong>, we should review in order not to forget what we have learned. 복습 is the word for this type of studying after learning.

매일 오늘 배운 내용을 복습한다.
I review what I have learned every day.

이해가 될 때까지 복습해야겠다.
I think I should review until I can understand it.

Reviewing is 복습 in Korean. Then, what is preparing, studying something before the class, in Korean? It is 예습.
