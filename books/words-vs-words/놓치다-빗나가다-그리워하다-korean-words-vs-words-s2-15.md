We try to get everything. But we can't. There are always something that we were missing. Today, we will learn Korean words about miss.

#  놓치다

When you missed what you had or what you thought you had, the word 놓치다 is used. It is used with something already in your hand or possession like missing the train you had to ride or missing the culprit on the site, etc.

I missed the fish I almost caught.

경찰은 현장을 덮쳤지만, 범인을 놓치고 말았다.
The police covered the site but missed the culprit.

#  빗나가다

There are always some kind of expectation. However, this expectation isn't always true. When you missed the expected result, it is called 빗나가다. It is used when you shot a gun but missed or your expectation is out of mark, etc.

그가 찬 공은 골대를 아슬아슬하게 빗나갔다.
He kicked the ball and it nearly missed the goal post.

내 예측이 그렇게 심하게 빗나갈 줄은 몰랐다.
I didn't know that my expectation would hugely miss like that.

#  그리워하다

Someone you love left. You cannot see him or her. You miss a lot. In this case, 그리워하다 is used. 그리워하다 is associated with the feeling you have when something or someone is missing.
