In the opening of this series, I've used the word, cover, a lot like "I'll cover the word today." So, let's cover "cover words" today. Cover has many meanings and there are really a lot of words for cover in Korean. Among them, I've chosen 5 words, 덮다, 감싸다, 가리다, 다루다, 대다.

#  덮다

If you put something over an object to cover it, it is called 덮다. When you cover yourself with blanket, it's 이불을 덮다. 



어제 내린 눈이 땅바닥을 하얗게 덮고 있었다. 
The yesterday's snow covered the ground whitely.

추우니까 이 모포로 무릎을 덮으세요. 
It's cold outside, so cover your knees with this blanket. 



Some of you might have eaten 덮밥. In this food, 밥 is covered with something on it. Because of that, it is 덮밥. 덮 here came from the verb, 덮다. 


#  감싸다

감싸다 is wrapping to cover something. While 덮다 is putting something on an object to cover it, 감싸다 is to cover something by wrapping it. 



그는 상처를 붕대로 감쌌다. 
He covered his wounds with bandage.

아이는 갑자기 두 손으로 얼굴을 감싸고 울기 시작했다. 
The kid suddenly covered her face and started to cry. 



In the second example, kid cannot cover her entire face with her hands. It's a kind of idiomatic use of 감싸다. 

#  가리다

Sometimes, we cover something to hide. In this case, you should use 가리다. 



그는 부끄러움을 가리기 위해서 웃었다. 
He laughed to cover his embarrassment. 

잘못을 가리지 말고 드러내. 그리고 더 열심히 하면 되잖아.
Do not cover your mistakes. Just reveal them. And then, work harder. 



#  다루다

If you cover a particular topic, you mean that you will discuss it in lecture, course, or book. This cover is 다루다 in Korean. The cover in opening of this podcast is 다루다. 



오늘 수업에서는 영어 단어 cover에 대해 다루었다. 
In today's course, we've covered the English word, cover.

그 주제까지 다루기에는 시간이 부족하다. 
We don't have time to cover that topic. 



#  대다

Cover is used with money like "to cover expenses". In this case, you can use the verb, 대다. 대다 is used a lot when the expense is covered by other people. 



부모님께서 4년 동안 학비를 대 주셨다. 
My parents have covered my tuition fee for 4 years. 

언제까지고 비용을 대 주기만 할 수는 없잖아. 안 그래?
We cannot cover your expenses forever. Right?



We've covered only 5 words. There are more verbs like 지불하다(paying), 답사하다(traveling, going), 엄호하다(military word), 걸치다(covering area), 대신하다(substitute), etc. There are nouns like 표지(book cover), 덮개(cover clothes), 보장(insurance cover), 대행(substitute) and so on. 

I cut the words to 5 because the episode will be too long if I cover all of them. I'll save these words for later.
