When we cook foods, we use fire a lot. When we use oil and fire to cook something, it is to fry in English. However, there are 5 words for frying in Korean: 굽다, 튀기다, 볶다, 지지다, 부치다. Let's learn about them one by one today.

#  굽다

Usually, 굽다 is used for roast or bake like 고기를 굽다(roasting meat) or 빵을 굽다(baking breads). However, when cooking meats, we sometimes use pans, especially for bacons. Koreans use pans when they cook 삼겹살. To your eyes, it looks like frying meat, but Koreans use the verb, 굽다 for 삼겹살.

웬 아침부터 삼겹살을 구워 먹고 있어?
Why are you eating 삼겹살 in the morning?

#  튀기다

Some foods are fried inside the oil like French fries or fried chicken. The verb, 튀기다, is used for them. When you pour a lot of oil into a pot or pan and cook the foods in it, it is 튀기다.

닭이 잘 튀겨졌네.
The chicken is fried well.

이 도넛 누가 튀긴 거야?
Who fried these doughnuts?

However, there is an exception to this. It's popcorn. When you are popping corns, you don't need to pour a lot of oil into a pot, it's just a little, but we still use the verb, 튀기다.

팝콘 튀기려면 버터 써야 하지?
We need butter to cook popcorn. Right?

The basic meaning of 튀기다 is to splash something. When you fry chickens or doughnuts, oil's splashing everywhere. When popping corns, the grains are popping everywhere. I think that it's why it is called 튀기다.

#  볶다

In some foods, you put little oil on the pan and fry and stir them for a while. This method is called 볶다 in Korean. The examples are curry and 볶음밥. Sometimes, it is translated as stir-fry.

점심은 볶음밥으로 하자.
Let's eat 볶음밥 for lunch.

햄과 고기를 잘 볶아 준 후에 야채를 넣습니다.
After frying ham and meat well, put in vegetables.

#  부치다, 지지다

Finally, you put little oil on the pan and wait for it to be cooked well, and then, turn it over to cook the other side. This method is used for pan cakes or 부침개, 파전, etc. It is called 부치다 or 지지다. This is also translated as pan-fry in English.

두부는 부치기 전에 물기를 제거해야 해.
Before frying 두부, you should get water out of it.

아버지는 저녁 때 먹을 빈대떡을 지지셨다.
Father fried 빈대떡 for supper.

Personally, I prefer 부치다 to 지지다. You can find 지지다 in dictionary, but if you search the word, it is a bit hard to find the example. In addition, in the definition of 지지다, there is 부치다 in it. So, use 부치다 more.
