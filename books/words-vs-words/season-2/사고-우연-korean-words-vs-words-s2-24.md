Accidents happen by accident. Because of that, accidents are called accidents. Sadly, Koreans use different words for those 2 types of accidents. They are 사고 and 우연. 

#  사고

사고 is the tragic or bad accidents. They are like car crash, airplane crash, explosion, etc. 



교통 사고 7건 중 1건이 졸음 운전 때문에 일어난다. 
Every 1 case in 7 traffic accidents happens because of driving while drowsy.

그 사고는 오전 10시에 발생했다. 
That accident happened 10 a.m.

폭발 사고가 있었지만 다행히 다친 사람은 없었다. 
There was an explosion. Fortunately, no one was injured.



#  우연

Good or not bad accidents are 우연 in Korean. This type of accidents is also called coincidence in English. When something lucky happens in a game or competition, it is called fluke. It is also 우연 in Korean.



그들이 일찍 도착한 것은 그저 우연이었다. 
It was just an accident that they arrived on time. 

우리가 만난 것이 정말 우연이었을까?
Was it just a coincidence that we met each other?

세상에 진짜 우연히 일어나는 일은 많지 않다. 
There are not many things in the world that really happen by accident.
