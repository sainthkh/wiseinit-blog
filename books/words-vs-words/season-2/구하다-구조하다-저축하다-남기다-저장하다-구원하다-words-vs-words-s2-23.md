When you learn a new language, the easy words we learn in the beginner course are getting harder when we study on because it is used in many contexts and many of which are a bit awkward in their mother tongue. The word, save, is one of them to Koreans. It can be translated as many words like 구하다, 구조하다, 저축하다, 남기다, 저장하다, 구원하다, 아끼다, 절약하다. For the meanings of 아끼다 and 절약하다, I've covered them before. So, in this episode, we will learn the other words. 


#  구하다

When you save someone from danger or difficulties, it is called 구하다 in Korean. 

 

영희는 물에 빠진 소녀를 구했다. 
영희 save the girl who fell into the water. 

홍수로 피해를 입은 분들을 구하기 위해서 모금을 시작했다. 
They started to raise money to save people in difficulty because of the flood. 

 

#  구조하다

구조하다 is also used to save someone from danger or difficulties. However, 구하다 can be used in almost any case where help is given to someone in need while 구조하다 is more like rescue in accidents. 구조하다 is used a lot in disasters or accidents when trained rescue teams try to save people in them. 

 

한 사람이라도 더 구조하기 위해 소방관들이 노력하고 있다. 
The fire fighters are trying hard to save more people even if it's just one. 

구조대가 늦게 도착하는 바람에 결국 아무도 구조하지 못했다. 
Because the rescue team arrived late, they couldn't save anyone. 

 

#  저축하다

When you save money in the bank, it is called 저축하다. 

 

저축한 돈을 다 써 버렸다. 
I used the entire money I saved in the bank. 

그는 노후를 대비해 저축을 했다. 
He saved money to prepare for his old age. 

 

#  남기다

When you save some food for somebody else, or to eat later, you should use 남기다. 

 

음식 내 것 좀 남겨 줄래?
Please save some food for me.

내일 먹으려고 남겨 뒀던 건데, 지금 먹어야겠다. 
I saved it for tomorrow, but I should eat it now. 

 

#  저장하다

When we are using computers, we should save frequently. It seems that save got this meaning because we save our file from being destroyed. This is 저장 in Korean. 

 

컴퓨터로 작업을 할 때에는 자주 저장해야 한다는 것을 잊으면 안 된다. 
When you are working with a computer, you shouldn't forget to save frequently.

저장하지 않아서 3시간 동안 작업한 것이 날아가 버렸다. 
Because I didn't save it, I lost 3 hours of work.

 

#  구원하다

The final word for save is 구원하다. It is usually used in Christianity context. The salvation, which means that we are all sinners of lying, greediness, hatred, etc., but Jesus saved us by dying and getting all the punishment which we originally had to get, is 구원 in Korean. 

 

예수님께서는 십자가에서 죽으심으로 우리를 죄에서 구원하셨다. 
Jesus saved us from sins by dying on the cross. 

하나님은 모든 사람이 구원을 받고 진리를 아는데 이르기를 원하시느니라. 
God will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.
