When there is everything in it, we use the word, complete. When we complete the work, we did the every work which should be done. When you complete the form, you filled out every blank in the form and the content of the form became complete. Let's learn about the words for complete.

#  마치다. 완료하다.

When some work, course, project is completed, we can use the word 마치다, 완료하다.

그녀는 얼마 전에 컴퓨터 공학 박사 과정을 마쳤다.
She completed Ph. D of computer science not long ago.

그 사업은 3년 내로 완료되어야 한다.
The project should be completed in 3 years.

As I said in 마치다 vs. 끝내다 in season 1 of Words vs. Words, 마치다 has the nuance that the course, term or work is ended naturally. It is used a lot in many cases that don't require much effort. It can be also used when something is poorly done.

However, in the case of 완료하다, the work should be done completely. It means that it can have some faults, but they should not be prominent. At least, it is error-free in your point of view even though your supervisor can find a bunch of them.

#  완전히, 완전한

마치다, 완료하다 are the verbs for complete. 완전히 is the adverb form and 완전한 is adjective form. 완전 is the noun form. However, sometimes, Koreans use 완전 for adverb like "완전 좋다"(completely good or very good), "완전 재미있다"(completely interesting or really interesting).

필요한 정보를 완전히 다 모으는데 5년 정도 걸렸다.
It took me 5 years to collect complete set of information.

다음달에 그들이 완전체로 컴백한다.
Next month, they will come back in complete form.

If you are interested in entertainment news, you can see the word, 완전체, a lot. It basically means complete body or complete form. In many girl groups or boy groups, there are many members in them. Sometimes, only a few members or a single person in a group comes back with new songs. Because of that, when they use the word, 완전체, all of the group come back with new songs or in TV shows, etc.

By the way, in Amazon, you can buy complete works of famous writers for less than $5 each. These complete works are called 전집 in Korean. 전(全) in 전집(全集) is the same 전 in 완전.

#  작성하다, 채우다.

Completing the form is 작성하다 or 채우다 in Korean. 작성하다 is one of the verb for write. It is used for forms or documents with tables like 성적표(report card), 시간표(time table), 설계도(design), etc.

2000명이 넘는 손님들이 설문지를 작성해 주었다.
More than 2000 customers completed the survey.

여권을 신청하기 위해 여러 장의 서류를 작성해야 했다.
To apply for a passport, I had to complete many forms.

In English, the expression, fill out the form, is also used. Likewise, Koreans use the verb, 채우다, fill, for the forms.

여기 표시된 곳들 좀 채워 주시겠어요?
Can you fill out the blanks I marked?

You can hear this expression in banks(은행) or public offices(관공서).
