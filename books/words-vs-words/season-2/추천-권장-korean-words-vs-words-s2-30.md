When we don't know what to choose, we get recommendations. In Korean, there are 2 words for recommend. They are 추천 and 권장. Sometimes, they are interchangeable. Mostly, both of them are used in different contexts. 

#  추천

추천 is used when you ask for other person's opinion.



내일 영화 볼 건데 추천 좀 해 줄래?
I am going to see a movie tomorrow. Can you recommend?

그 책보다는 이 책을 추천하고 싶어. 
I want to recommend this book rather than that. 

추천 받고 간 식당이었는데, 맛이 별로 없었어. 
I went to the restaurant he recommended, but the food wasn't good. 



When you get a job, you sometimes need a letter of recommendation. It is 추천서 in Korean. In it, there are opinions about the person, because of that, it is called in that way.

In Internet, you can see the word, 강추, it is the short form of 강력 추천 meaning "highly recommended".


#  권장

When you use 권장, this word is not used for asking opinions like "책 좀 권장해 줄래?" It's 추천. Usually, 권장 is used for the list or table of recommended items. For example, the recommended books for kids are 어린이 권장 도서. The recommended daily intake is 하루 권장량. Usually, these recommendations are from experts. So, 권장 is used a lot with expert recommendations. 



청소년 권장 도서 목록을 봤는데, 책들이 너무 어려운 것 같아. 
I've read the list of recommended books for youth. It seems that books are too hard. 

하루 권장량 이상 먹으면 안 돼.
Don't eat more than the recommended intake. 

초등학생 대부분이 하루에 권장 시간 이상의 공부를 하는 것으로 나타났다. 
It is revealed that most of the primary school students study more than recommended hours. 



If you visit a game website in Korea, you can find the word, 권장 사양, a lot. It means the recommended spec for the game. As you all know, that's the table of recommended specs of CPU, RAM, graphic card, etc. You can know why it's 권장 사양, not 추천 사양. The minimal spec is called 최소 사양. 

This is the end of season 2 of the Words vs. Words series. Next week, I'll cover counting words like 개, 그루, 명, 권, etc. Thank you for listening and see you next week.
