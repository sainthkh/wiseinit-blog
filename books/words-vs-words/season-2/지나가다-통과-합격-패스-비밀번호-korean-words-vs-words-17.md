The word pass is used in many contexts. 

When you walk on the road to somewhere else, you pass. 
When you pass the gate, it is also pass.
When the law is approved, it is passed. 
When you pass the ball in ball games, it is also pass.
Finally, we need passwords to login websites. 

These passes are not the same word in Korean. Let's learn them one by one. 

#  지나가다

When you pass or walk along the road, it is 지나가다 in Korean. 

 

몇몇 사람들이 지나갔지만 아무도 도와주지 않았다. 
Several people passed but no one gave me any help. 

그녀는 길에서 인사도 하지 않고 지나갔다. 
She didn't say hello on the way and passed me. 



Someone who passes is called passerby in English. It is 지나가던 사람 in Korean. Sometimes, you can see the name field of comments section in blog whose name is 지나가다 in Korean. The person who wrote it just stumbled upon that post and cannot think of the name, so they named themselves as 지나가다. Some bloggers hate this name, so don't use it too much. 


#  통과

When there is a gate, door, or approval to pass through, it is called 통과. 

 

관문을 통과하기 위해서는 통행증이 있어야 한다. 
To pass the gate, pass is needed. 

보초가 졸고 있는 틈을 타서 몰래 통과했다. 
I passed in secret when the sentry was dozing off. 

 

통과 is also used when a law or regulation is passed. 

그 법은 180대 110표로 통과되었다. 
The law was passed by 180 votes to 110.

In some quiz shows, you can pass some questions by saying "pass". In Korean, it is "통과". However, some Koreans say "패스" to do so. 


#  합격

When you pass an exam or you pass a college, it is called 합격. If you like watching audition TV shows, you can hear this word a lot. The antonym of this word is 불합격.

 

그렇게 시험에 한번에 합격할 줄은 몰랐다. 
I didn't know that I could pass the test at once like that. 

우선 이번 단계에서는 합격 드리겠습니다. 
I will give you pass in this stage. 



#  패스

In ball games, you should pass strategically to get more score. In this games, pass is also 패스 in Korean. 

 

박지성이 패스한 공은 이영표에게 전달되었다. 
The ball passed by Ji-sung Park is delivered to Young-pyo Lee.

그 때 내가 패스만 제대로 했어도 이겼다고.
At that time, if only I passed well, we could win.
