The word, order, is used a lot in English. It is used when we want to talk about the increasing or decreasing order of objects, or we want everything in order. Many supervisors order us something to do. In restaurants, they take our orders for food. Let's talk about them one by one.

#  순서/ ~순

When some objects are ordered in increasing or decreasing sequence, it is called 순서 in Korean. However, in many cases, it's just shortly 순 after some nouns.

이름들이 알파벳 순으로 나열되어 있다.
The names are ordered alphabetically.

When something is ordered in 한글 order, it is called 가나다 순, because 한글 starts with ㄱ, ㄴ, ㄷ.

번호 순으로 서 봐라.
Stand in the order of number.

In school, each student has his or her own number. That's why we can hear this phrase a lot in schools.

중요한 순서대로 일을 처리했다.
I finished the work in the order of priority.

As you can see, 중요한 is adjective form, so the whole word is used. It is really awkward to use 순 here. If you want to use 순서 in previous examples, use 순서대로 other than 순으로 like following:

이름들이 알파벳 순서대로 나열되어 있다.
번호 순서대로 서 봐라.

#  정리

When you clean and organize your room or idea in order, it is called 정리 in Korean.

글을 쓰기 전에 어떻게든 생각을 정리해 봐야 해.
Before writing, you should order your ideas in any way.

그 방은 정리가 잘 되어 있었다.
That room was in good order.

#  질서

While 정리 is for the small area like rooms or your brain, 질서 is for the big area like public order, community rules.

그 도시의 질서 유지를 위해 군대가 파견되었다.
An army was dispatched to keep the order of that city.

동물의 세계에도 그들만의 질서가 있다.
The animal world has its own order.

#  지시, 명령

If someone higher than you commands or orders something to be done, it is 지시 or 명령 in Korean. Both of the words are usually interchangeable.

사장은 직원들에게 새로운 프로젝트를 시작할 것을 지시했다.
Boss ordered his employees to start a new project.

그녀는 회장의 명령만을 따른다.
She only follows the order of the president.

#  주문

When you enter a restaurant, you are usually asked, "may I take your order?" The order here is 주문 in Korean.

주문하시겠습니까?
May I take your order?

이 책을 2권 주문했다. 하나는 내가 읽고 다른 하나는 선물 하려고.
I ordered 2 volumes of this book. I will read one and I will give other as present.
