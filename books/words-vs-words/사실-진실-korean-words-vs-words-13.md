The truth sometimes bothers us, but it is usually better to know than to ignore it. Today's words are 사실 and 진실. We will see the facts and truths about them.

#  사실

사실 is usually translated as fact. It means what you have heard or experienced. We all think that what we saw are true, but you can always find some prejudice and bias in our experiences. In addition, they are partial and imperfect. 사실 only tells you some part or fraction of the truth, 진실.

#  진실

진실 is the truth. It indicates what really happened. Everything is true and there is no lie and nothing wrong in 진실. There is no bias or prejudice. It is whole and perfect. Everything is crystal clear. If any kind of lie is added to 진실, it becomes 사실. To know the 진실, you should collect 사실s and see what is going on between them.

#  To Tell You the Truth...

In English, when you say something which was once a secret, the expressions like "frankly speaking" or "to tell you the truth" are used. Although it is truth in English, it is 사실 in Korean. Koreans say "사실은 말이야" or simply "사실."

사실은 말이야, 어제 그 꽃병을 깬 것은 나야, 윤아가 아니고.
