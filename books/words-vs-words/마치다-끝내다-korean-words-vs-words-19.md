Where there is a beginning, there's an end. We should try hard to end our works. We will learn 2 words about getting works done. They are 마치다 and 끝내다.

#  마치다

마치다 means to end or finish something. It is usually used when you don't have to put much effort to end it. As time flows if we try hard or not, it is usually used with time.

#  끝내다

끝내다 is causative form(사동) of 끝나다(end), so 끝내다 means make it end or make it finish. Being causative means that you should try hard to make something happen. That's the difference between 마치다 and 끝내다. The verb, 마치다 is used when works or other things end whether you try hard or not. In contrast, the verb, 끝내다 is used when you need to put some effort to end the work. Therefore, 끝내다 is usually used together with specific tasks because you should do our best to finish them.
