When we write something, we edit a lot to make it better. We change contents, paragraphs, grammars, etc. In Korean, there are 2 words for edit. They are 수정 and 편집. Let's check them out today.

#  수정

When we edit something, we are trying to correct or rectify something wrong or inappropriate. We are changing it to make it better. 수정 is used when you want to emphasize the meaning of correction in edit.

The content of the writing wasn't good so I had to edit it heavily.

#  편집

If you are an editor, you gather contents and cut and adapt them to make a whole new content. It is also called edit in English, but this process is not 수정, it is 편집 in Korean. In 편집, it doesn't have the meaning of cutting out something wrong and filling with something better. It has a meaning of choosing the correct or good content for the final draft according to the pre-decided rule or guideline. So, it is used a lot when you edit magazine(잡지), or video(동영상).
