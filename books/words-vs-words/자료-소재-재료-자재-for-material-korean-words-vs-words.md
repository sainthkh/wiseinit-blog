There's nothing new under the sun. We make something new from what we have around us. The things we use to make something is called materials in English. Particularly, the materials we put in our foods are called ingredients. In Korean, there are 4 words for material: 자료, 소재, 재료, 자재. Let's see these words one by one.

#  자료

When you research something, we need a lot of materials. We find them and organize them to write or teach something. The word, 자료, is used for researches, it is not much used in other contexts.

#  Examples

강의를 준비하기 위해 자료를 수집하고 있다.
I am collecting materials to prepare the lecture.

자료가 너무 많다 보니 분석하는데 시간이 오래 걸린다.
As there are so many materials, it takes a lot of time to analyze them.

이번 논문에 필요한 자료를 찾기 위해 인터넷을 검색해 보았다.
I searched the Internet to find some material for my paper.

#  소재

The second word is 소재. It is used in two contexts: arts and state-of-the-art materials.

#  Examples for Arts

둘 다 미래 사회를 소재로 한 드라마인데 하나는 시청률이 높았고, 하나는 낮았다.
Both of the TV series are about the future society, but one of them was popular and the other was not.

조선시대 왕들의 일상을 소재로 한 소설을 써 볼까 생각 중이다.

#  Examples for the State-of-the-Art Material

이번 제품은 우리 회사에서 새롭게 개발한 소재를 사용해 제작되었습니다.

For these state-of-the-art materials, you can use 재료 we will learn next in the place of 소재.

#  재료

The third word is 재료. It is most common word for material. Except for the special cases for 자료, 소재, 자재, almost every material is 재료. In English, the materials for foods are called ingredients, but they are also called 재료 in Korean.

#  자재

The final word for material is 자재. It is usually used for construction(건설). It is rarely used in other contexts.

#  Examples
