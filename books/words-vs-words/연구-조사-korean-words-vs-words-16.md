We cannot remember everything, so we should always do some research. 연구 and 조사 or research and investigation are what we do to get some information. Both of them have their own context, sometimes they overlap, but other times they don't. Let's see the difference now.

#  조사

조사 is usually translated as investigate, or survey. It is usually done outside of school or laboratory. As a special case, census is 인구 조사. It is a single word in English, census, but it is called as population(인구) survey(조사) in Korean.

경찰은 범행 여부를 조사하기 위해 그를 소환했다.
The police summoned him to investigate whether he really committed the crime.

올해 인구 조사는 90년간 이루어진 현장 방문 방식이 아니라 기록 조사 방식으로 이루어진다.
The census this year will not be done by personal visit but by record investigation

수요 조사 결과 많이 팔릴 것이라 예상했는데 거의 팔리지 않았다. 뭔가 문제가 있다.
After the survey of demand, I expected that it will be sold well, but it was hardly sold. There is some problem.

#  연구

연구 is usually translated as study or research. It is usually done inside school or laboratory with academic topics.

연구에 몰두하다 보니 벌써 10시가 된 것도 몰랐네.
I didn't know that it was already 10 o'clock as I was buried in research.

우리는 항상 20세 이상 성인 남성들만 대상으로 연구를 진행했다.
We always have been researching on males over 20 years old.

연구 성과가 나오기까지는 긴 시간이 필요할 것 같다.
It might take long time to see the result of the research.

#  Finding Materials is 조사

There is a special and confusing case of 조사. As finding or searching information is part of our research, it is called research in English, but Koreans prefer to use 조사 for the finding process.

강의를 만들기 전에는 수많은 자료를 조사해 봐야 다.
Before making a lecture, you should research a lot of materials.

책을 쓰기 위해 필요한 것들을 조사하기 위해 도서관을 찾았다.
I went to library to research the materials for my book.

무엇부터 조사해야 할지 모르겠어서 선생님께 여쭈어 보았다.
I asked my teacher because I didn't know where to start my research.
