I want to open some secret about Korean. The noun open is translated into two different words in Korean, they are 개방 and 공개. Let's see what is the difference between them.

#  개방

개방 is the opposite of close or shutdown. It is used mostly with places or spaces.

그 도서관은 특이하게 평일에 개방하지 않고 휴일에만 개방한다.
That library strangely opens on weekends, and doesn't on week days.

그 연구실은 항상 개방되어 있으니까 편할 때 와서 쓰시면 돼요.
The lab is always open, so you can use it when you feel convenient.

사무실은 항상 개방되어 있으니 궁금한 것이 있으면 들어오세요.
The office is always open, so come ask whenever you have something curious.

#  공개

공개 is the opposite of secret, it means making something public or disclosed.

100년 넘게 전해져 내려온 요리의 비법을 공개하기로 결정했다.
They decided to disclose the cooking secret which come down more than 100 years.

치킨을 만드는데 들어가는 원가를 공개했지만, 아직도 많은 사람들이 치킨이 비싸다고 생각한다.
They opened the production price of fried chickens to the public, but many people think that they are expensive.

박물관에 보관되어 있던 6.25 전쟁에 관한 기록이 오늘 공개된다.
The record about Korean war which was kept in the museum will be disclosed today.

#  When are they Interchangeable?

In cases above, 공개 and 개방 are not interchangeable, but sometimes it is.

그 회사는 창고를 공개하기로 결정했다.
그 회사는 창고를 개방하기로 결정했다.
The company decided to open the warehouse.

In these sentences, you can choose what you want to emphasize. If there were something really important, so you had to close the warehouse. As the time went on, the thing became less valuable, so it didn't matter to you to make it public. Then, you should use 공개. If you want to emphasize the fact that the place is now open for everyone after the years of shutdown, then you can use the word, 개방.
