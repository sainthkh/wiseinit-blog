When we postpone something, we say later. We will learn two words about later in Korean, 이따가 and 나중에. Both of them mean later, but they indicate different time.

#  이따가

If you find 이따가 in the dictionary, you can see the word, 조금, a little. 이따가 is used when you want to emphasize the short period of time.

할 것이 너무 많아서 이 일은 조금 이따가 해도 될까? 오늘 내로 해 줄게.
I have too many things to do. Can I do this a little bit later? I will surely do it today for you.

지금 사람이 너무 많아. 이따가 이야기하자.
There are too many people here now. Let's talk about it later.

어제도 안 오셨잖아요. 그러니까 이따가 좀 들러 주세요.
You didn't come yesterday too. So please come here later today.

#  나중에

나중에 means some time later. It can be long or it can be short. It is OK if it is not now. However, usually it is longer than 이따가.

오늘은 좀 힘들 것 같고, 나중에 보자.
I think it's a bit hard today. Let's meet later.

제가 지금 좀 바빠서 그런데 이 일은 다른 일들 다 하고 나중에 해도 되겠습니까?
I am a bit busy now. Can I do it later after I finish all of my tasks?

Sometimes 나중에 means later in the sequence. In this case, you should only use 나중에 even though it's only 5 minutes later.

우리가 맨 나중에 할 거래. 이러면 뭔가 불안한데.
He said that we are the last. It sounds somewhat bad.

3조가 4조보다 먼저 한다고? 원래 나중에 하는 거 아니었어?
Did you say that team 3 will do it earlier than 4? Weren't they supposed to do that later?

#  있다가?

If you listen to the word, 이따가, you may guess that it starts with 있. However, it starts with 이 and 따 with double consonant ㄷ follows it. 있다가 with 있 and 이따가 with 이 have different meanings. 있다가 with 있 has nothing to do with later. It is a combination of 있다 and 가. It means someone or something is located or doing something and after that some other thing happened. Simply, it is "and then." It is used when playing games and then going to store for some food, or sleeping and then waking up after the big sound, etc.

집에 있다가 심심해서 거리로 나왔다.
I was in my home and went out to the street because I had nothing to do.

침대에서 세상 모르게 자고 있다가 큰 폭발 소리에 잠을 깼다.
I slept like a log and woke up after the big bang sound.

돈은 있다가도 없고, 없다가도 있는 것이니 크게 신경 쓰지 않는다.
I don't care much about the money because you sometimes have it and you sometimes don't have it.
