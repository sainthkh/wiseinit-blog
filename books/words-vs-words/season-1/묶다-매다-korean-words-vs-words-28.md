We will learn 묶다 and 매다 today. They both mean to tie something, but they are used in different cases.

#  묶다

If you tie something with a strap to tidy up when cleaning or organizing something, then it is 묶다.

청소하기 전에 먼저 머리를 묶었다.
I tied my hair back before cleaning the house.

이사 때 들고 가려고 책을 끈으로 묶어 놓았다.
I tied my books with a strap to bring them when I move.

#  매다

When you tie something to steady or hold something, you can use 매다.

그는 잠시 고개를 숙여 신발끈을 맸다.
He lowered his head briefly to tie his shoe string.

바람이 거세게 불어서 날아갈만한 것들을 기둥에 매어 놓았다.
The wind is so strong that we tied everything on the pillar that can be blew away.

If what you are doing now is steadying stuffs to tidy or clean something, you can also use 묶다. In examples above, you can use 묶다 because you tidy your shoe string and you are tying up things before the wind blows them all away.

#  묶다 Only - Intangible things

With 묶다, you can tie some intangible or abstract objects like novel(소설), case(사건), problem(문제), etc. You should only use 묶다 for these words. In these cases, 묶다 is usually translated as collect, compile, etc.

그는 그 동안 썼던 단편소설들을 묶어서 책으로 내기로 했다.
He decided to collect the short novels he has written and publish them as a book.

전혀 다른 사건 같지만, 그가 관련되어 있다는 점을 생각해 보면, 이 사건들은 하나로 묶어서 보아야 합니다.
It looks like they are separate cases, but if we consider that he is involved in both cases, we should treat them as a single case.

#  매다 Only - Wear Something

When you tie something around your body, it is only 매다. You cannot use 묶다 here.

넥타이를 꼭 매야 하나? 불편한데.
Do I have to wear the tie? It's too uncomfortable.

승객 여러분의 안전을 위하여 안전벨트를 꼭 매 주시기 바랍니다.
For your safety, please buckle up your seatbelt.

#  매다 Only 2 - Hang Something

When you are tying up something on the wall to hang something, then 매다 is more frequently used than 묶다. If you want to be clear, you can also use the verb, 매달다 for this kind of usage.

오빠는 여동생을 위해 그네를 나무에 맸다.
Big brother tied a swing on the tree for his sister.

빨랫줄을 베란다에 매려고 하는데, 좀 도와줄래?
I am going to tie the clothesline in the veranda. Can you help me?
