We make many things for our daily use. Some of them are tangible like computers, cars, foods, others are intangible or abstract like software, notion. Today we will learn the words to make these things in Korean. They are 생산, 개발, 계발, 제작, 제조

#  생산

생산 is used when you produce something for our daily lives. They are usually tangible. You cannot only use the word for natural fruits like peach, rice, but also can you use this word for industrial merchandises like cars or smartphones.

쌀 소비량은 줄고 있지만 쌀 생산량은 줄어들고 있지 않다.
The consumption of rice is decreasing, but the production of rice is not.

현대가 처음 자동차를 생산할 때만 해도 참 작은 회사였는데, 지금은 큰 회사가 되었다.
When Hyundai first produced cars, it was really small company, but it became really big now.

#  개발

개발 is used to develop a new natural resources like forest(삼림 개발), oil(유전 개발). When you make something improve, then you can use the word, 개발, too. The examples are 경제 개발(economical development), 관광지 개발(development of tourist attraction). It is also used when you create something new like 소프트웨어 개발(development of software), 신제품 개발(development of new product).

정부는 유전 개발에 투자하기로 결정했다.
The government decided to invest on oil development.

1962년부터 1996년까지 한국은 경제 개발 5개년 계획을 시행했다. 그 결과로 지금과 같은 엄청난 발전을 할 수 있었다.
From 1962 to 1996, Korea had executed the 5 year plan of economical development. As a result, they made this dramatic economical development.

소프트웨어를 개발하는 데 드는 비용이 사서 쓰는 비용보다 크다.
The expense it takes to develop a new software is higher than the cost to buy them.

#  개발 vs 발전

Yesterday, I talked about 발전 and today I did about 개발. Both words can be translated as develop in English. Then, what is the difference? 발전 is usually used to describe the state of improvement like 과학 기술의 발전(improvement of science and technology). Good science and technology are developed and it is now in a good state. 개발 is used to emphasize the action of developing and it is used to develop something new from almost nothing. In our examples, when you say 유전 개발, you have to find the oil source and develop it. The 유전, oilfield, doesn't exist yet when you start to develop it. Before 경제 개발 5개년 계획, the economy of Korea is totally ruined. After that, they tried hard to make it better. After the efforts, they got the improved state, and it is called 경제 발전.

#  계발

계발 sounds really similar to 개발. The meaning is really similar, too. It also means improvement or development. However, it is used with people. When you make some skills or abilities of people better, it is 계발. The examples of 계발 are 자기 계발서(self help books), 잠재력 계발(the development of potential).

자기 계발서 독서 후에는 그 책의 내용을 실천해야 하는데, 정말 쉽지 않다.
After reading self help books, you should practice what is written in them. It is not easy.

아이들이 잠재력을 계발할 수 있도록 도와주어야겠다.
I should help those kids to develop their potential.

#  제작

제작 is used when you create a new product. Particularly, if it is an art like music, movie, TV series, then you should only use 제작.

그 기계는 설계가 끝이 나고 제작 단계에 들어갔다.
The design of the machine is finished and now in production stage.

요즘은 다들 mp3로 음악을 들으니까 CD나 DVD로 된 음반 제작을 잘 안 하는 것 같더라.
Most people listen to music with mp3 files, so it seems that they don't make albums in CDs or DVDs.

#  제조

제조 is used when something is made in a factory. The common examples are 자동차 제조, 스마트폰 제조.

그는 핸드폰 제조 과정의 문제를 발견하고 고치기 전까지 공장을 세우라고 지시했다.
He ordered to stop the factory until they found out the problem in the process of cell phone production and fixed it.

빵 제조 공장이라길래 무척 클 줄 알았는데, 그냥 작은 가게였다.
They said about bread factory, so I thought it would be really huge, but it was a small shop.

As usual, I intended to end Korean Words vs Words series with 30 episodes, but there was a request about the comparison of the words, 발달, 발전, 생산, 개발, 제작. I first thought that I could end it with a single episode. After I researched those words and found out that the words can be categorized into 2 meanings, improvement and produce, so I had to make one more episode to answer the question.

This is the end of the Korean Words vs Words series. Thank you for listening until the end of the series. Tomorrow, I will talk about Konglish words. Konglish words are the words that came out from English or other language but have different meaning. Thank you for listening and stay tuned for Konglish words series.
