We will learn the differences between the words, 들어내다 and 드러내다. Like 너머 and 넘어, it sounds same if you only listen to the podcast. The first one starts with 들 and the second one starts with 드.

#  들어내다

#  드러내다

드러내다 with 드 means to reveal something. It is a 사동(causative form) of the verb, 드러나다, to be revealed.
