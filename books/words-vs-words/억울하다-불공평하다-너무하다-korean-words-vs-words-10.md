It would be really fantastic if everything is fair and square. We all know that it is just a fantasy, not a reality. For these unfair cases, Koreans use the 3 words: 억울하다, 불공평하다, 너무하다. Let's see one by one.

#  억울하다

The word, 억울하다, is the emotion you get in the unfair situation. When you are in an unfair situation, you feel something desperate, frustrating, uneasy and so on. 억울하다 is there to describe your heart. Because of that, 억울하다 is frequently used with people like 나는 억울하다, 너는 억울하다, etc.

누명을 쓴 것이 억울하지도 않아? 어떻게 그렇게 태연한 거야?
You should be frustrated by the false accusation you get. Why are you so calm like that?

잘못도 없는데 언론을 통해 그렇게 질타를 받는 것이 많이 억울했다.
I thought that it was really unfair that I got such denunciation the media and I did nothing wrong after all.

나는 그 동안의 노력이 모두 물거품이 된 것이 억울했다.
I felt it was really unfair that the efforts I had put for such a long time became nothing.

#  불공평하다

불공평 is used to describe the unfair systems or rules.

똑같이 노력했는데 저만 많이 받는다면 그건 불공평한 일입니다.
Everyone tried hard. If I get something more, that is unfair.

세상이 불공평해 보이지만 생각만큼 그렇게 불공평하지는 않은 것 같다.
It seems that the world is unfair, but it also seems that it is not that unfair than we think.

불공평하다고 불만만 이야기하면 될 일도 안 돼. 빨리 방법을 찾아 보자.
If we keep complaining about the unfair situation, the works that can be done will not be done. Let's plan our next steps quickly.,

#  너무하다

In spoken Korean, when you want to show your 억울함 or speak some complaints to the people who made the 불공평한 rule, 너무하다 is used. The basic meaning of 너무하다 is too much. If too much resource, advantage, or love is given to a single person or to a group, we say that it is unfair. Then, you may understand why 너무하다 is used in unfair situations.

10시간이나 기다려야 한다니. 너무하시네요.
Do I have to wait for 10 hours? That's unfair.

조금 더 겸손해지길 바라면서 그렇게 했던 것인데 그는 내가 너무하다고만 생각하는 것 같군.
I did it because I wanted him to be more modest, but he thinks I did something unfair to him.

내가 너무하다고? 네 잘못은 하나도 생각하지 않고 있구나.
Am I unfair? You are not thinking what you have done wrong.
