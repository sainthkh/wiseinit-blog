As I had works to do, the upload was late. I am really sorry for that.

Following are 5 expressions you can learn from Running Man Episode 246(여배우 납치 사건: 거짓 탐정의 비밀, Kidnapping Case of an Actress: The Secret of Fake Detective). I hope you have fun with the episode and the words.

#  눈치

눈치 means to notice the mind of other people by watching the situation. To notice something, we use our eyes a lot, I think that is the reason the character 눈(eye) is in the word.

There are many idiomatic expression you can use with 눈치. Following are famous ones:

* 눈치(를) 채다: to notice something or realize something.
* 눈치가 빠르다: good or fast at noticing something
* 눈치가 없다: really bad at noticing something
* 눈치를 보다: to wait for the consent from others. To watch what others are doing.

눈치가 빠른 녀석이 있어서, 잘 될 지 모르겠다.
There is a guy who's fast at noticing something. I don't know it will go well.

눈치 채기 전에 얼른 도망가야겠다.
I should leave before they notice it.

계속 왜 내 눈치를 보지?
Why are you waiting for me?

#  실마리

The original meaning of 실마리 is the lead of skein(a roll of thread looking like a ball). When you start to use a skein, you should find 실마리 and start from there. The meaning used in this episode came from that.

To solve the problem which looks as complicated as a skein, you should find the starting point, 실마리. That's why 실마리 got the meaning, clue, or hint.

사건의 실마리가 좀처럼 풀리지 않는다.
I can't get the clue of the problem.

문제의 감추어진 실마리를 찾아 헤매는 중이다.
I am now trying to find the hidden clue of the problem.

#  알쏭달쏭

알쏭달쏭 is used when something looks like correct or wrong. It is not clear so it is hard for you to distinguish one from the other.

If you read the last episode, you learned the expression, 긴가민가, 알쏭달쏭 and 긴가민가 are similar expressions. Although 긴가민가 is used when you are not confident whether it is wrong or right, 알쏭달쏭 is used when you are confused with something. Sometimes, it has nothing to do with correctness.

세금 신고 규정이 알쏭달쏭한 면이 있다.
The regulation for tax report has some confusing elements.

알쏭달쏭한 연금 용어를 쉽게 설명해 드리는 시간입니다.
This is the time to explain confusing pension term in easy words.

#  화기애애(和氣靄靄)

![2015-05-16-11_43_29-Greenshot.png ](/images/2015-05-16-11_43_29-Greenshot.png )

화기애애 is used when the atmosphere is warm and bright. The people around you talk kindly and friendly.

화(和) means peace and 기(氣) means energy and it means atmosphere here. 애애 in 화기애애 is double 애(靄) and it means spring haze(아지랑이). Like haze in the spring, the peaceful atmosphere is going up and it surrounds the group of people. You can guess why 화기애애 got the meaning of peaceful/warm/bright atmosphere.

다른 날과 다르게 오늘 회의 분위기가 많이 화기애애했다.
Unlike other days, the atmosphere in the meeting was really bright and warm.

처음에는 화기애애하게 진행되었으나 점차 목소리가 격해졌다.
At first, it was warm and bright, but the voices became louder and more aggressive.

#  쥐도 새도 모르게

![2015-05-16-11_58_55-Greenshot.png ](/images/2015-05-16-11_58_55-Greenshot.png )

It means secretly.

It is not clear why 쥐(mouse) and 새(bird) should not know what we are trying to do when we want to do something secretly. However, many people guesses that it came from the saying, 낮 말은 새가 듣고, 밤 말은 쥐가 듣는다. Word by word translation of this saying is "what you said in the day is heard by birds and what you said in the night is heard by mice". It teaches us that we should be careful about what we are saying. It is usually translated as "walls have ears" in English.

As mice and birds hear what we are saying constantly if we take the saying seriously, we can keep our secret if we avoid 쥐들 and 새들. This might be the reason why mice and birds are in the expression.

쥐도 새도 모르게 만나야 할 것 같다.
I think we should meet secretly.

매년 데뷔하는 걸그룹이 50개 정도는 돼서 쥐도 새도 모르게 사라지는 그룹들도 많다.
As the number of girl groups that debut in a year is about 50, so there are some groups that disappear silently.
