#  덩그러니

When a single stuff or stuffs are in the large area, it is called 덩그러니 in Korean.

In dictionary, there is '-다'-ended form, 덩그렇다. But only 덩그러니 or 덩그렇게 is used. In my personal opinion, 덩그러니 is more commonly used than 덩그렇게. If you search Naver blog, 덩그렇게 only has less than 7000 results, but 덩그러니 has more than 200,000 results.

I think most appropriate word for 덩그러니 in English is all by itself.

책상 위에는 얼마 전까지 내가 사용하던 드럼 채가 덩그러니 놓여 있었다.
On top of the desk, there was a drumstick I used not long ago all by itself.

그 아이는 덩그러니 의자 위에 놓여 있던 책을 집어 들었다.
That kid picked up the book on the chair all by itself.

#  몸부림

When you struggle to get out of something or moving your body fiercely, it is called 몸부림 in Korean.

몸부림 is the combination of two words, 몸 and 부리다. As you all know, 몸 is body and 부리다 is showing something continuously. 부리다 is used like 늑장을 부리다(procrastinate), 고집을 부리다(being stubborn), etc.

When you struggle, you can show the body a lot. That's why struggling is 몸부림.

It is usually used with the verb, 치다 like 몸부림을 치다 or 몸부림치다.

몸부림 좀 그만 쳐 줄래? 다 너를 위한 것이라고!
Can you stop your struggle? All of this is for your own sake.

그는 괴물의 손아귀에서 벗어가기 위해 강하게 몸부림쳤다.
He struggled a lot to get out the hand of the monster.

#  매듭짓다

When you finish, conclude, wrap up some work or project, it is called 매듭짓다 in Korean.

매듭 means knot. The basic meaning of 매듭짓다 is making or tying a knot.

Think about making a parcel, or packaging a present. You end the process by tying a ribbon(knot?) on the top. It is interesting that English has similar expression, wrapping up.

It is the synonym of the well known word, 마무리 짓다.

결국은 영수가 나서서 상황을 매듭지었다.
Eventually, 영수 had to wrap up the situation.

일을 시작하는 것 이상으로 중요한 것이 매듭짓는 것이야.
Wrapping up is much more important than starting a work.

#  지긋지긋하다

When you are sick of something or fed up with something, it is called 지긋지긋하다 in Korean.

이광수 is famous for his bad luck. Like usual, his bad luck made the team lose in the mini game. That's why 지긋지긋한 is used here.

네 변명 들어 주는 것도 지긋지긋하다.
I am fed up with hearing your excuses.

지긋지긋한 이 프로젝트도 다음 달로 끝이구나.
This tiring project will be ended in the next month.

#  신신당부

Sometimes, you are requesting something repeatedly, it is called 신신당부 in Korean.

당부 is usually used by older or higher people to younger or lower people to do or not to do something. It is something like this:

When kids travel to somewhere, parents are worried and tell them what to do before they depart. These last minute warning or checkups are 당부 in Korean.

When you 신신당부 something, you do this 당부 repeatedly or earnestly.

그렇게 가지 말라고 신신당부했는데 그는 떠났다.
He left although I begged him not to go.

이 모든 것이 어머니의 신신당부를 무시했던 결과였다.
All of these were the result of ignoring the warning by my mother.

This is the citation from an old poem in Korea, 서시 by 윤동주. It means "It felt pain even by the little wind on the leaves."

He was a poet in Japanese Colonization era and he tried to express his pain in that era by the quote. In this quote, he tried to say his regret of doing nothing for the nation.

However, in this screenshot, they are startled even by the little wind. So, the makers of Running Man cited it for fun. It has nothing to do with regret.

Following is entire poem of 서시:

죽는 날까지 하늘을 우러러
한 점 부끄럼 없기를,
잎새에 이는 바람에도
나는 괴로워했다.
별을 노래하는 마음으로
모든 죽어가는 것을 사랑해야지
그리고, 나한테 주어진 길을 걸어가야겠다.

오늘 밤에도 별이 바람에 스치운다
