#  휘둥그레

![1.png ](/images/1.png )

When you are startled, your eyes become bigger. 휘둥그레 is used to describe these eyes.

휘둥그렇다 is the basic form of 휘둥그레, but it is hard to find the real usage of 휘둥그렇다. Another adverb form of 휘둥그렇다, 휘둥그렇게, is not used much as well.

Just memorizing 휘둥그레 as wide-eyed is fine.

갑작스런 소리에 놀라 그는 눈을 휘둥그레 떴다.
He opened his eyes wide because he was startled by the sudden and big sound.

그 아이는 생전 처음 보는 규모의 인형을 보고 놀라 눈을 휘둥그레 떴다.
That kid opened her eyes wide as she was surprised by seeing the biggest doll in her life.

#  엄친아

I don't know how other countries like, but in Korea, mothers compare their kids with other family's kids. Usually, their comparison is usually done with the grades in school.

These mothers say something like this: "엄마 친구 아들은 수능이 전부 1등급이고, 서울대 갔다는데 너는 이게 뭐니?"(The son of my friend got all first grade in 수능 and entered SNU. What are you doing now?)

It is not educationally good way. Actually, it's really destructive. Sadly, many mothers use this method and many people share their wounds and it became a word. This word was firstly introduced in one episode of webtoon, 골방환상곡(Midnight Rhapsody), you can see the first episode [here](https://comic.naver.com/webtoon/detail.nhn?titleId=15441&amp;no=9).

From this meaning, those who are really good at many things, usually study, are called 엄친아.

그 아이가 엄친아일 줄은 몰랐네.
I didn't know that he was good at everything.

너같은 엄친아들이 어떻게 나같은 사람을 이해하겠어.
How can the people like you who are good at everything understand the people like me?

엄친아 is for male and female word is 엄친딸. As you can guess, it is shortened form of 엄마 친구의 딸.

#  허당

![3.png ](/images/3.png )

Like 엄친아, 허당 is not in dictionary, too.

It is said to be originated from the dialect word, 허당, meaning useless work.

허당 is used a lot in 예능 shows, because there are many characters who try to do something well, but fail almost every time. They make 예능 shows fun.

When a person shows a lot of 허당 actions, it is called 허당끼가 많다.

참 완벽한 배우가 그렇게 허당끼 많은 사람일 줄 몰랐다.
I didn't know that a perfect actor like him was such clumsy.

항상 허당이었던 멤버가 제일 먼저 성공했다.
The member who was always clumsy succeeded first.

#  그나저나

![4.png ](/images/4.png )

This word is shown in RM a lot.

It is used to change the topic.

It is usually translated as anyway.

그나저나 이 아이는 왜 안 오는 거지?
Anyway, why doesn't he come back?

그나저나 이번 프로젝트는 언제 끝나는 거지?
Anyway, when will this project finish?

#  막무가내(莫無可奈)

![5.png ](/images/5.png )

Sometimes, some people make us do something stubbornly or obstinately. This is called 막무가내 in Korean.

Both 막 and 무 means non-existence. 가 means possible. 내 means how. It can be translated as it is impossible to do something.

그렇게 막무가내로 끌고 가지 마!
Don't take me that forcefully.

막무가내로 자기 생각만 고집하니 어떻게 할 수가 없네.
I cannot do anything because she is too stubborn about her idea.

#  수학이 제일 쉬웠어요.

![6.png ](/images/6.png )

This phrase is the parody of the book title, 공부가 가장 쉬웠어요, The study was the easiest. This book is the story about the lawyer who had many jobs and finally entered Seoul National University. I covered him before in [a 수능 episode](/the-students-who-took-%EC%88%98%EB%8A%A5-well/).

Because of this provocative title(we all know that study is not easiest), it is parodied a lot like above.
