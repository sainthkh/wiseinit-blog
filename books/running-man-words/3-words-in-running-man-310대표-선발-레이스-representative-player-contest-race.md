국가대표 is a member of the national team. 국가 means nation and 대표 means representative. So, it means a athlete who represents a nation. 

When you become a 국가대표, it is 국가대표가 되다. However, you can sometimes find some expressions like "태극 마크를 달다". 국가대표s have a small national flag on their uniforms. In Korean flag, the blue and red circle is called 태극 무늬. So, it is a 태극 마크. 

Sometimes, 국가대표 is used to call someone who is really good at something. It's natural that those athletes should be really good to be in national teams. You can use this style of writing in other fields like writing, baking, etc.

막장 originally means the end in the mine gallery. 막장 is deep inside and it is really dangerous. It is possible that the roof of the mine can fall and he/she entered there cannot go out. Because of that, no one wants to go in there. However, the payment is really good. 

So, if someone goes there to earn money, his life is not in a good state. He's really desperate to earn money. From this, 막장 describes something which became the worst or as bad as possible. 

If some drama is 막장, it means that the story arc became as immoral as possible. These dramas have kills, divorce, kids from other wives, etc. The story is really bad and predictable, but sadly, these dramas have good rates(시청률). 

인생 막장도 아니고 왜 그렇게 사는 건데?
