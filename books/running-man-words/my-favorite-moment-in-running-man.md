The screenshots are taken from Episode 178.

This is the last episode of 2013. The title was 연말정산 meaning <em>End of Year Calculation</em>. RM team was mad about too many water games. RM team and producing team(제작진) made a bet that there would be no water games in cold days if RM team wins.

The pictures are from the second game of the episode and RM team are told to make paper boats to cross Han River(한강).

I love this moment because of RM team's passion and spirit. They failed and fell into the river in the middle of winter, but they tried again and finally succeeded crossing the river with paper boat they made with their own hands at the second try.

We make mistakes and fails, but we can try again until we can succeed. That makes us even stronger. The comments in the pictures  tell us what to do in the hard days.

끝까지 포기하지 않는 그들을
이 순간, 도전 자체를 즐기고 있는 그들을
포기하는 것이 진짜 지는 것임을 아는 그들을

(They now cheer for them)
who never give up
who enjoy the challenge itself at the moment
who know that giving up is the real loss.

When you learn Korean, or do other things, there are a lot of challenges. We cannot succeed every challenge we meet. However, I hope you have fun with the challenge. That's the most important. I learned it from this episode.

#  Words &amp; Phrases


#  포기

포기 means to give up. Many of you readers heard of this word. However, there is a homonym of 포기. 포기 is also used when you are trying to count cabbage(배추).

Because of that, some people tell you when you are trying to give up.

포기는 배추 셀 때나 쓰는 표현이다.
포기 is the word for the count of cabbages.

It is impossible to translate this sentence in English. That's why I added this word.

#  자체

If you want to say itself for emphasis, it is usually called 자체 in Korean like 도전 자체(challenge itself) in our example.

생각 자체는 문제가 없어 보이는데, 실행이 문제지.
I guess that there is no problem in idea itself, but the problem is the practice of the idea.

물건 자체만 보면 괜찮은데, 우리 회사가 요즘 사정이 안 좋아서.
The product itself is good, but the state of our company is not good these days.

It has nothing to do with the example, but 자체 is used when you want to say self or its own.

그 공장은 자체 발전 시스템을 갖추고 있다.
The plant has its own power generating system.
