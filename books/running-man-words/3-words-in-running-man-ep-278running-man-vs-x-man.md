#  화수분

When something precious is continuously created and never decreases, it is called 화수분 in Korean.

This word came from old China. The first emperor of Qin Dynasty, Qin Shi Huang, made the famous Great Wall. To build that wall, much water is needed. So, he built the enormous bucket on the mountain and let people fill that bucket and use the water from it.

As the bucket was too big, the water in there didn't decrease at all even if you use a lot. It was called 하수분(河水盆) and changed into 화수분. This word, 화수분, figuratively calls the source where something precious is continuously generated.

개그 콘서트는 대한민국 코미디의 화수분이다.
Gag Concert is the unlimited source of Korean comedy.

두산 베어스는 화수분 야구로 유명하다.

The word is usually used for something good. But it is used for something bad, 독설, biting remarks.

Someone is not good at acting, but for some reason, he has to do so. Then, it is called 발연기 in Korean.

발 here means your foot. Koreans use the word 발 a lot when something is a mess like 발로 그린 그림(messy or grotesque drawing), 발로 쓴 글씨(unlegible or unable to read handwriting), etc.

발연기 is the shortened form of 발로 한 것 같은 연기(really bad acting).

발연기이긴 한데 무척 웃겼다.
His acting was bad, but it was really hilarious.

그녀는 한 때 발연기로 유명했으나, 지금은 무척 잘 한다.
She was once famous for her bad acting, but she is now really good.

You ate something but it doesn't digest well. To make matters worse, this thing doesn't digest well for a long time. It is called 체증 in Korean. From this basic meaning, this got two other meanings.

First one is congestion. When there is a traffic jam, it is called 교통 체증. Like the undigested food, cars cannot move. Because of that, it is called 체증.

Secondly, it is used when something is unsolved. Many people were curious about 김종국 and 윤은혜 in X-Man series. That's why the 체증 is used here. When 체증 is used in this form, it is used a lot like (period) 묵은 체증. In (period), add long period like 5년, 10년, 30년, etc.

그 구간은 교통 체증이 심하다.
That area is notorious for its congestion.

15년 묵은 체증을 날려 버린 골이었다.
It was the goal that removed the pain of 15 years.
