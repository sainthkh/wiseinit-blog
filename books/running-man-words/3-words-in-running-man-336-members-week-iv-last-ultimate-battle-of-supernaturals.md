빈틈 is used as a single word. There is no space between the 2 characters. However, it came from the 2 words, 빈 and 틈. 빈 means open. It came from the adjective, 비다. 틈 means crack, gap.

So, 빈틈 means crack or gap. But it also has the meaning of weak points. 

Think about martial arts. A person is guarding his body, there was an opening in his guard. Then, that opening is his weak point. So, 빈틈 got the meaning of weak points or flaw, drawback.
