As you can guess easily, 디지털 here means digital in digital appliances. 울렁 in 울렁증 came from the word, 울렁거리다, and it is used when your heart pounds or thump. Particularly, it is used when you feel like you are about to vomit.

When you are not good at something, it makes you feel nervous. If that nervousness becomes really intense, you can feel some pain in your stomach. The word 울렁증 came from this situation. 증(症) here means disease.

In short, 울렁증 is used to call fear of something because you are not good at it. It is used a lot with 영어, English. It is a common knowledge that most of Koreans are not good at English. Many of them have 영어 울렁증.

디지털 울렁증이 있어도 괜찮아요.
It is OK to have digital phobia.

이 강의 덕택에 제 영어 울렁증이 사라졌어요.
Thanks to this lecture, my English phobia is gone.

There are always some foolish questions, but many wise and insightful people answer them wisely. These answers are called 우문현답 in Korean. 우(愚) means foolish, 문(問) means question or ask, 현(賢) means wise, 답(答) means answer.

그 아이의 답변은 우문현답의 좋은 예이다.
The answer of that kid is the good example of wise answer to foolish question.

This word originally came from military. It is used for the staffs of the commander. As those staffs advise the commander to command well, it got the meaning advisors.

The commander is called 사령관 or 지휘관.

The word by word translation of 표정관리 is facial expression management. It is used when something very good or very bad happened. When something like that happens, it shows on your face.

It is usually OK to show your face. However, it is not a good idea if you want to be modest or show respect or hide your sorrow, etc. In those cases, you try hard to hide or manage your facial expressions. That's why it is called 표정 관리 in Korean.

표정 관리가 안 되네.
It is hard to hide that from my face.

그 사람은 정말 표정 관리의 달인이야.
He is really good at hiding his expression from his face.
