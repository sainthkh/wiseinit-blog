This is called 등잔 밑이 어둡다 in Korean. It basically means that under the lamp is dark. As lamps shine the room, so it seems easy to find anything right under the lamp. However, because of that, you just believed there was nothing in there and couldn't find it sooner. 

From this basic meaning, it is used to say when you are partially blinded for the easy things. 

In English, it can be translated as "Husband is always the last to know."

They say, "husband is always the last to know." I was blinded and I couldn't find it right next to me.
