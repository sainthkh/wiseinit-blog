Everyone of us has his or her favorite food. When some dish is a kind of your favorite food, it is called 입맛에 맞다 in Korean. On the other hand, if it isn't your favorite, it is 입맛에 맞지 않다 or 입맛에 안 맞다.

This word came from the two words, 입 and 맛. 입 is mouth and 맛 is taste. So, 입맛에 맞다 means it is your taste. 입맛에 맞지 않다 is not your taste.

입맛에 맞는 음식들을 골라 왔어.
I have gathered the foods of my taste.

입맛에 맞으실지 모르겠네요.
I don't know these are your taste.

Like the word, taste, in English, 입맛 is also used figuratively to show one's taste in other things like 입맛에 맞는 영화(the movies of your taste), 입맛에 맞는 일(the works of your taste), etc.

#  한술 더 뜨다

When you are going over board or doing something worse than expected, it is called 한술 더 뜨다. It is usually used in negative context.

For example, your colleague did something wrong to you. But he doesn't look sorry, but he's even angry at you. You can use 한술 더 뜨다 here.

그는 미안해 하기는커녕 한술 더 떠서 내게 소리를 쳤다.
He didn't say sorry and even yelled at me.

현재 유가가 배럴당 30달러까지 떨어졌는데, 그는 한술 더 떠 10달러까지 떨어질 것이라고 예측했다.

When somebody else is looking for opportunity to get your precious things, it is called 호시탐탐 in Korean.

호(虎) means 호랑이(tiger). 시(視) means to see. 탐(眈) means to glare or stare. It basically means the glare of tigers. Like tiger looking and waiting for its prey, someone is bidding their time to steal or rob something, it is called 호시탐탐.

In Running Man, members and guests bid their time to rip other people's name tag or steal some precious items. This word is used for that situation.

유재석은 호시탐탐 김종국의 이름표를 노렸다.
