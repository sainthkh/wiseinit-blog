When you are really startled, you can use words like 매우, 무척, 엄청. However, you can also use the word, 화들짝. This word is used when someone is very startled.

Because it is used when someone is surprised, you can see the word 화들짝 with the verb, 놀라다, a lot.

화들짝 놀라는 모습도 귀엽다.

You cannot find this word in dictionary. It is the compound word of 칼 and 군무. The second word, 군무, is not military service. It is group dance.

칼 here came from the knife. When many people act with discipline, it is called 절도 있다 in Korean. When this discipline goes to the extreme, there is no room for exception and you can feel some power or awe. Then, people use the word to describe this 절도 as 칼 같은 절도, discipline like knife.

When some groups dance with disciplined action, it is awesome. So, it can be translated as awesome group dance.

그 칼군무를 보여 주기 위해 얼마나 연습했을까?
How much did they practice to show that awesome group dance?

그 아이들의 춤은 "칼군무는 이렇게 하는 거야"라고 이야기하는 것 같았다.
The dance of those kids seemed to tell us, "awesome group dance is the word for this."

#  쐐기

When there is an argument, people are divided. Finally, boss said something crucial and it is decided in that way. 쐐기를 박다 is used like this situation. Something is decided and made sure that something wrong would not happen later.
