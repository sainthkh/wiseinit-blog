미련 없다 means to have no regret. 

Some of you might have wondered the difference between 미련 and 후회. 

미련: 깨끗이 잊지 못하고 끌리는 데가 남아 있는 마음.
To not be able to forget it clearly and you still want it. 

후회: 이전의 잘못을 깨치고 뉘우침.
To repent what you did wrong before. 

When you did something wrong, you repent and try not to do it again. After the repentance, you regret it because you lost what you could get. This mind is called 미련. Because of that, 미련 and 후회 are usually interchangeable. 

미련 없이 끝냈다고 생각했는데 계속 생각이 난다. 
I thought I finished it without any regret, but I cannot forget it. 

정말 미련 없을 정도로 다 해 봤다.
