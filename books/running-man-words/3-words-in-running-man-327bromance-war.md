When something is in the middle or center of something, it is called 한복판에 있다. As it is the word to describe a place, it is usually used with 있다 a lot. Interestingly, it is rarely used with 없다, because it has a nuance of emphasizing the centerness. 

It has nothing to do with 한복, Korean traditional clothes.
