약방 means medical house or pharmacy or hospital. These days, everyone gets subscriptions from doctors and gets medicine from pharmacies. However, it is still not the case in traditional Korean medicine industry. They prescribe and create medicine in the same clinic. 

감초 is the medical herb used to make the medicine sweet. Because every traditional medicine(한약) is bitter, 감초 is added to every medicine.

He is always there. We cannot miss him.

선거에서 부정부패 해결 공약은 약방의 감초처럼 빠지지 않는다.
