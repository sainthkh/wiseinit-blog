I will tell you some tips and tricks to pronounce Korean more naturally. The first tip is consecutive consonants.

#  Even though consecutive consonants are pronounced only once in English,

In English, a consonant is pronounced once although it is written twice. Let's see some examples.

Summer. M is pronounced once. It is not [sum mer].
Collection. It is not [col lection]
Announce. It is not [an nounce]

There are more examples like Mommy, Anna(name of Elsa's sister), connection, etc.

#  ㄴ, ㄹ, ㅁ, ㅇ are pronounced twice in Korean.

However, in Korean. When ㄴ, ㄹ, ㅁ, ㅇ are consecutive, they are pronounced twice. Let's check it out with the dubbed Frozen video.

Check 0:17.

In this video, Anna introduces herself to Olaf. When she says her name, she says "난 안나야." When she pronounces her name, she says ㄴ twice like 안 and 나, 안나. It's not 아나 or 애나. As you can see, 애나 sounds more similar to the original name.

Actually, you learned this when you started learning Korean. It's 안녕하세요, hello in Korean. When you pronounce 안녕하세요 like [아녕하세요], it sounds like beginners doing it. It is more proper to pronounce it like 안녕하세요. Pronounce 안 first and 녕 after that. Then, it becomes 안녕하세요.

It is a rare case, but if you ignore this rule, then you can confuse the listener. The example for this situation is 얼리다 and 어리다. 얼리다 means to freeze and 어리다 means to be young.

겨울이 다 돼 가는데 물을 왜 얼려 왔어?
Why did you bring frozen water? The winter is around the corner!

어리다고 놀리지 말아요.
Don't tease because I am young.

This is from the lyric of the song, 소녀시대 by 소녀시대. The names of the song and team are same.

Let's see more word examples.

만나다(meet), 건너다(cross), 분노(anger).
울리다(make someone cry).
응원(cheering up), 영원(forever, eternality).
맘마(baby word for food), 엄마(mom), 감마(third character of Greek, gamma)

#  ㄱ, ㄷ, ㅂ are pronounced once, but stronger

As many of you know, every Korean character ends with 7 sounds, ㄱ, ㄴ, ㄷ, ㄹ, ㅁ, ㅂ, ㅇ. We cover four of them here, ㄴ, ㄹ, ㅁ, ㅇ. Then, how about the other 3 characters? Are they pronounced twice? They are not.

Let's see with 3 words.

학교[하꾜], school. ㄱ is not pronounced twice. It is pronounced once and as ㄲ.
압박[압박], pressure. ㅂ is not pronounced twice. It is pronounced once and as ㅃ.
걷다[거따], walk. ㄷ is not pronounced twice. It is pronounced once and as ㄸ.
