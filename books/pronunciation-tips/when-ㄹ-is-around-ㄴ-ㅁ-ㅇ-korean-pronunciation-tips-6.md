In Korean, there are only 7 ending sounds, ㄱ, ㄴ, ㄷ, ㄹ, ㅁ, ㅂ, ㅇ. We've covered what happens when 6 of them are consecutive yesterday.

In previous episode, there was no ㄹ. I didn't intentionally cover ㄹ, because it should have its own category. We'll learn today what happens if ㄴ, ㅁ, ㅇ meets ㄹ.

#  ㄹ and ㄴ


#  ㄴ + ㄹ =&gt; ㄹ+ ㄹ

When ㄹ is after ㄴ, ㄴ becomes ㄹ. Let's see with an example.

언론에서는 그 사건이 순리대로 풀렸다고 이야기했다.
In the media, they said that the case was solved along the ways of nature.

언론 sounds like [얼론].
순리 sounds like [술리].

#  ㄹ + ㄴ =&gt; ㄹ + ㄹ

Interestingly, this rule happens when ㄹ is in front of ㄴ. In this case, ㄴ again becomes ㄹ.

줄넘기를 100개 정도 했다.
I jumped rope about 100 times.

난 너처럼 잘난 사람이 아니라고.
I am not a smart person like you!

In these examples, 줄넘기 sounds like [줄럼끼], 잘난 sounds like [잘란].

#  Exceptions: ㄴ + ㄹ =&gt; ㄴ + ㄴ

However, there are some exceptions to this [ㄴㄹ] to [ㄹㄹ] rule. <strong>When a character is added to the existing word, [ㄴㄹ] sound becomes [ㄴㄴ] sounds.</strong> Let's see some examples.

이 병원은 입원료가 비싸다.
The fee for hospitalization in this hospital is expensive.

생산량을 두 배로 올려야 해요.
We should double our production.

입원료 sounds like [이붠뇨], not [이붤료]. 생산량 sounds like [생산냥], not [생살량].

Other examples that doesn't follow this rules are 결단력[결단녁](the ability to decide), 발전량[발쩐냥](the amount of electricity generated), etc.

#  ㅁ, ㅇ + ㄹ =&gt; ㅁ, ㅇ + ㄴ

When ㄹ is after ㅁ, ㅇ, ㄹ becomes ㄴ. Let's see some examples.

그 음료를 먹으면 담력이 생겨?
If you drink that, does it give you some courage?

궁리 끝에 장력을 동력으로 사용할 수 있다는 것을 알게 되었다.
After consideration, I found out that tension can be used as power.

음료 is [음뇨]. 담력 is [담녁].
궁리 is [궁니]. 장력 is [장녁]. 동력 is [동녁].

In the next episode, I will cover the final combination of consonant assimilation, ㄹ with ㄱ, ㄷ, ㅂ.
