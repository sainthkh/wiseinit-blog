For some of you, 으로써 and 으로서 sound same to your ear. Although both of them look and sound similar, they have different meaning and are used in different contexts. That's today's topic.

#  으로써

으로써 is used when you want to say material, means or tools, or count. In English, it is usually translated as 'by.'

숲을 파괴함으로써 우리가 얻는 것이 무엇인가?
What can we get by destroying forests?

친환경 차량을 보급함으로써 환경 보호에 기여한다.
By distributing environment-friendly cars, we contribute to the protection of environment.

그는 그 대학에 진학하기로 결정함으로써 학비 부담을 해결했다.
By deciding to enter that university, he solved his tuition problem.

숲을 파괴함(destroying a forest), 친환경 차량의 보급(the distribution of eco-friendly cars) and 그 대학에 진학(entering that university) mean means or tool for the goal.

#  으로서

으로서 is used when you want to talk about quality, rank. In English, it is usually translated as "as" in the sense of "as a teacher," "as a scientist," "as the person who studied chemistry," etc.

선생님으로서 네가 잘못하는 것을 보고만 있을 수는 없다.
As a teacher, I cannot just see you doing wrong.

주장으로서 해야 할 일을 했을 뿐입니다.
I just did what I had to do as a captain.

컴퓨터 공학 전공자로서 그런 코드는 용납할 수 없습니다.
As the person who majored computer science, I cannot accept the code like that.

As many other grammar rules in Grammar vs. Grammar series, it is one of the grammar that even native speakers use wrong. Many other rules are used correct in newspapers. However, this rule is even sometimes wrong in newspapers. 으로서 is written as 으로서 but read as 으로써. That might be the reason.
