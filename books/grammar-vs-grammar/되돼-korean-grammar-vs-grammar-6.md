Today we are going to talk about the difference between 되 and 돼. The first one ends with simple ㅣ, the second one is the character you can see in 돼지, pig, which ends with ㅐ.

Both of them came from the word 되다. However, when 어 is added after 되, it becomes 돼. Then, let's see 돼 with examples.

#  With Past Tenses

When making past tense, Koreans use 었 a lot. When 었 is added after 되, then it becomes 되었, and it is shortened to 됐. Because of this rule, there is nothing like 됬 in Korean because there is always 었 behind 되 when you are talking about something happened in the past.

철수는 축구 선수가 됐고, 영희는 변호사가 됐다.
철수 became a teacher and 영희 became a lawyer.

어른 다 됐네.
Wow, you are an adult.

The last sentence, 어른 다 됐네, is used between an adult and a kid. When a kid acts like an adult, many adults say this to compliment him or her.

#  Some Endings that Start with 어

If an ending starts with 어, you should also use 돼 there.

#  -어서

It is used when you want to say reason(because or so), the order of time(after), or means or way to do something(by doing something). As 되다 means to become, 되어서 usually means because.

나 며칠 뒤 유학 가게 돼서 이거 너 주려고.
I am going to study abroad soon, so I want to give it to you.

영화 촬영을 미국에서 하게 돼서 몇 달 간 한국에 없을 거야.
As I am going to film in US, I am not in Korea for a few months.

Although there is no because in these examples, you can see that 되어서 is used to show reasons.

#  -어야.

When you want to say something that must or should be done, then add -어야 next to a verb stem.

난 꼭 가수가 돼야 해.
I must be a singer.

좋은 선생님이 되기 전에 먼저 좋은 사람이 돼야 해.
Before becoming a good teacher, you should be a good person first.

#  At the End of Sentence.

If it is at the end of sentence, it is 돼. It is used when you want to command or order. In addition, it is used when you give permission or recommendation.

안 된다면 안 돼.
If I say not, you should not.

꼭 가 봐야 돼. 꼭 와 달라고 했단 말이야.
I should go. She told me to visit by all means.

다 됐어. 이제 먹기만 하면 돼.
It is all done. Now all we have to do is eating.

그냥 감사하는 마음을 표시할 수 있는 것을 드리면 돼요.
It's just OK to give something you can show your appreciation.

#  되

Finally, it is about 되. If 어 is not in the back of 되, then it's just 되. The examples of conjugation of 되 are 되고, 되니, 되다, 된, 될, 됨, etc.

난 꼭 선생님이 될 거야.
I will become a teacher at all cost.

다 된 줄 알았는데, 아직도 많이 남았네.
I thought it was done, but there was still a lot of them.

되고 안 되고를 떠나서 그렇게 말하면 누가 좋아하겠냐?
Apart from being OK to do that or not, who will like you if you say something like that?
