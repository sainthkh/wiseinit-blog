We will cover another similar sound verbs today. We are going to learn the difference between 들어내다 and 드러내다. Although I read 들어내다 as 들어내다 to discriminate them, the pronunciations of both of them are same, 드러내다.

#  들어내다

들어내다 is the combination of the two verbs, 들다 and 내다. 들다 means to pick up and 내다 means to bring something to someone or something, so 들어내다 means take something out of a place. If you want to take out something, you should first pick it up(들다) and bring it out(내다). It is not hard to remember.

방에 쌓여 있던 책들을 전부 들어냈다.
I took out all of the books stacked up in the room.

창고에 있던 상자들을 전부 들어내 버렸다.
I took out and dump every box in the warehouse.

생선에서 내장을 들어내고, 양념에 집어 넣었다.
I took out intestines from the fish and marinated it.

#  드러내다

드러내다 came from the word, 드러나다. It is the 사동 form of 드러나다(to be revealed). It is sometimes wrongly used by even journalists. You can find some errors in newspapers like 모습을 들어낸(revealing figure). It should be 모습을 드러낸.

숨겨왔던 실력을 드러내기 시작했다.
He started to show his real ability.

그 여배우는 팔꿈치에 상처가 있어서 그곳을 잘 드러내지 않는다.
