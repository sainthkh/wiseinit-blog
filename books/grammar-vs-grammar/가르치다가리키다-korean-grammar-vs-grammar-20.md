As 가르치다 and 가리키다 sound similar, they are a bit confusing even to native speakers. Sometimes, native speakers use some words like 가리치다, 가르키다, 아르키다, 아르치다, etc. All of these words are wrong words, so don't use them. There are only 2 correct words, 가르치다 and 가리키다.

#  가르치다

가르치다 means teach. When you teach, you let others know something new. That's why the odd verbs like 아르치다, or 아르키다 came out. I think it is the combination of 가르치다 and 알다. Unlike English, 가르치다 is sometimes used like just tell. When you tell someone a secret, the verb, teach, is not frequently used in English, but in Korean, it is.

If you have any idea, please let me know.

가르쳐 주셔서 감사합니다.
Thank you for teaching.

내가 비밀을 하나 가르쳐 줄게.
I will tell you a secret.

#  가리키다

가리키다 means indicate. When you indicate some place or objects with your hands, feet, or other objects, then you can use the verb, 가리키다.

그녀는 손가락으로 태양을 가리켰다.
She indicated the sun with her finger.

왜 책상 위를 가리키고 있는 거야?
Why are you indicating the top of the desk?

손으로 가리키면 비밀이 드러날 텐데. 어떡하지?
If I point it with my hand, the secret will be revealed. What should I do?
