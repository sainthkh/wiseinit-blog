We learned about 은가 싶다 and 보다 yesterday. We will learn more about 싶다. Today's topic is comparing 을까 싶다 and 으면 싶다.

#  을까 싶다

을까 싶다 is used in two contexts.

#  1. Worrying or Fearing Something

&nbsp;

The first one is about worrying or fearing about the situation. It is usually translated as lest. Sometimes, it just look like because.

혼 날까 싶어 얘기도 못 꺼냈어.
I couldn't even start to talk about it lest you got scolded.

더울까 싶어서 안 가고, 하루 종일 집에서 에어컨 틀고 있었어.
I didn't go there and was at home while turning on the air conditioner all day long, because I thought it was too hot .

#  2. Intend to Do Something

When you intend to do something, Koreans use 을까 싶다. The difference between ~고 싶다 and 을까 싶다 is the strength of the will. ~고 싶다 shows stronger will than ~을까 싶다.

그냥 바닷가로 여행이나 떠나볼까 싶다.
I am now wondering whether I just go to the sea for a trip.

소설이나 써 볼까 싶다.
I am wondering whether I will write a novel.

Some of you might have wondered, there is any difference between 을까 싶다 and 을까 보다. I tried to find that and concluded that they are interchangeable.

#  으면 싶다.

We want something a lot, but sometimes they are simply unrealistic now. 으면 싶다 is used for the case.

일찍 갔으면 싶었다.
I wish I went earlier.

일이 좀 적었으면 싶다.
I wish I had less works.

그녀를 좀 보았으면 싶었지만, 떠날 시간이 다가왔다.
I wanted to meet her, but the time for leaving was approaching.

There is no 으면 보다 in Korean. This is the case where you should only use 싶다.
