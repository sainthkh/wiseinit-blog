We learned 3 words that pronounced like [낟다] yesterday. We will learn other 3 words that sound like [바치다]. They are 바치다, 받히다, 받치다. Although 3 of them are pronounced like [바치다]. I pronounce them character by character like [바치다] and [받히다] and [받치다] to discriminate them.

#  바치다

바치다 means to give or dedicate. It is usually used to God, adult, government, or someone or some organization higher than you.

이 책을 이제까지 저를 돌보느라 고생하신 부모님께 바칩니다.
I will dedicate this book to my parents who had hard time to take good care of me until now.

목숨을 바쳐 나라를 구한 분들을 기억합시다.
Let's remember the people who gave up their lives to save our country.

#  받히다

받히다 is the 피동 form of 받다(hit), so it means to be hit. It is the synonym of 부딪히다.

투우사들은 소에 받히지 않기 위해 조심한다.
Bull fighters are careful not to be hit by the bulls.

영희는 신호등을 무시하고 달려오는 차에 받혀 크게 다쳤다.
영희 was badly wounded because she was hit by the car that ignored the traffic light.

#  받치다

받치다 means to support or hold something with other things. Supporting cups with a tray is a typical example. When you learn Korean, you learn that the last consonant is called 받침. This 받침 is the noun form of the verb, 받치다. In Korean characters, 받침s support or hold up other 2 sounds. That's why they are called 받침.

쟁반에 커피를 받쳐 들고 손님들에게로 달려왔다.
She held the cups of coffee on the tray and ran to the guests.

우산 받쳐 줄게.
I will hold the umbrella for you.

Strictly speaking, the standard sound of 받치다 is [받치다]. ㄷ is not ignored, but 바치다 and 받치다 sound really similar even to native speakers. That's why I told you that the sounds are almost same in the beginning of this episode.
