Where there is a beginning, there is an end. There is the time to start the work, and there is the time to end it. When we talk about the starting and end point, we usually use "from A to B" like "I had done that work from 2001 to 2003".

In Korean, in the place of from, you can use 에서 and 부터 and 까지 is used for to. 에서 and 부터 are usually interchangeable, but there are some cases that they are not. We will learn about that conditions today.

#  When They are Interchangeable

When we are talking about specific time with numbers like 1시(one o'clock), 2시(two o'clock), or specific year like 2015년, 1937년, or specific date of the week like 월요일, 목요일, or specific date in a month like 2일, 5일, 29일, you can use 에서 and 부터 interchangeably.

1시에서 4시까지는 집에 있을 거예요.
I will be at home from 1 to 4.

2012년부터 2014년까지 미국에 있었어요.
I was in US from 2012 to 2014.

월요일에서 금요일까지 정말 열심히 일했으니, 주말은 쉬자.
As we worked really hard from Monday to Friday, let's take some rest on weekend.

In examples above, you can use 에서 and 부터 interchangeably.

#  When They are Not Interchangeable


#  1. Without Numbers

When you are talking about the time without numbers like 작년(last year), 재작년(2 years ago) or 어제(yesterday), 그저께(the day before yesterday or 2 days ago), then you should only use 부터. 에서 is not usually used in this case.

재작년부터 올해까지 제가 읽은 책은 200권이 넘어요.
The books I read from 2 years ago to now are more than 200.

김 선생님은 어제부터 모레까지 휴가이십니다.
Dr. Kim is on vacation from yesterday to the day after tomorrow.

#  2. With 전, 후, 넘어서

When you use the words like 전, 후, 넘어서 with the time numbers like 2017년 전부터(before 2017 or earlier than 2017) or 5시 후부터(after 5 o'clock), you should only use 부터.

2008년 전부터 2012년까지 그는 재택 근무를 했다.
From earlier than 2008 to 2012, he worked from home.

3일 후부터 6월 말까지 구매하고 싶은 물건들의 목록이야.
This is the list of the things I want to buy from after 3 days to the end of the June.
