Many words are confusing because they sound similar, but 바라다 and 바래다 sound different clearly, but many people use 바래다 when they should use 바라다. It's kind of habitual thing. We will learn the difference and common mistakes.

#  바라다

바라다 means hope. It is used when you want to tell what you want.

나는 별로 바라는 것이 많지 않아.
I have only a few wishes.

바라는 것을 이루는 것만큼 즐거운 일도 없지.
There is nothing more delightful than finishing what you have wished.

보수를 바라고 한 일이 아니야. 좋아서 한 거지.
I didn't do it for payback. I did it for fun.

#  Wrong Usage of 바라다

Many people use 바래다 in above cases. They pronounce like 나는 별로 바래는 것이 많지 않아. 바래는 것을 이루는 것만큼 즐거운 일도 없지. 보수를 바래고 한 일이 아니야. They are all wrong, but Korean language learners should know it because many native speakers talk like this.

The noun form of 바라다, 바람 is also pronounced as 바램. It is just my opinion. I think 바램 is more prevalent than 바람, but it is wrong. It seems that many Koreans use 바램 instead of 바람 because they want to discriminate their wishes from wind. However, 바람 is correct for your wishes.

#  바래다

바래다 means to fade or lose color. If a sheet of paper gets sunlight for a long time, the color is changed. It is called 바래다.

누렇게 바랜 오래된 벽지 위에 새 벽지를 발랐다.
Over the old wallpaper faded to dirty yellow, we pasted new one.

색이 바래기는 했지만 아직 쓸만하다.
It lost its color, but it is still useful.

그렇게 색 바랜 옷은 그만 입어. 내가 새로 사 줄게.
Don't wear the faded clothes like that. I will buy you some new ones.
