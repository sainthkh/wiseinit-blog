The irregular verb group of today is ㅎ irregular. ㅎ irregular verbs are really different from other irregular verbs. The rule is really interesting. 

The basic rule, irregular conjugation happens when markers or endings that start with a vowel are appended to the verb, is exactly same. But the conjugated form is really odd. 

When these verbs meet markers or endings that start with 으, ㅎ and 으 are eliminated. For example, if we conjugate 빨갛다 with -으니, it is not 빨갛으니, but 빨가니. If 으면 is appended, it should be 빨가면. 

When ㅏ/ㅓ are appended, ㅎ is eliminated and ㅏ/ㅓ becomes ㅐ. ㅑ becomes ㅒ. For example, if 빨갛다 is conjugated with 어서, it is 빨개서. When 하얗다 is conjugated 았다, it is 하얬다. 

Irregular Verbs: 파랗다(blue), 퍼렇다(dark blue, strong blue), 빨갛다(red), 뻘겋다(dark red, strong red), 노랗다(yellow), 누렇다(dirty yellow), 하얗다(white), 그렇다(in that way), 동그랗다(circular)
Regular Verbs: 좋다(good, well), 쌓다(stack), 빻다(crush, grind), 놓다(put), 낳다(give birth to)

As you can see, this irregular rule only happens to descriptive verbs or adjectives except 좋다.
