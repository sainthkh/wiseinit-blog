We'll learn another group of irregular verbs in Korean. It's ㄷ irregular. Like many other irregular verbs, the irregular conjugation happens when the verb meets endings or markers that start with vowels. When this happens, the 받침 ㄷ changes into ㄹ. 

Irregular Verbs: 걷다(walk), 깨닫다(realize), 듣다(listen, hear), 싣다(load, put something in), 누구에게 묻다(ask)
Regular Verbs: 닫다(close), 믿다(believe, trust), 쏟다(spill), 얻다(get), 땅에 묻다(bury)

Because of the car crash, he couldn't walk for a year. 

차 트렁크에 싣고 다니는 불필요한 물건들을 없애면 기름값이 절약된다. 
If you get rid of unnecessary items in the car trunks, you can save gas. 

At the end of the verbs, the endings or markers that start with consonants are appended like 걷지, 싣고. So, the conjugations are regular.

As you can see in 믿을, 믿어, 닫은, 쏟았다, 얻으려고, the endings or markers that start with vowels are appended to the verbs, but 받침 ㄷ is not changed at all. 


#  묻다 

I didn't include 묻다 above, because the conjugation of 묻다 changes according to its usage. 

When you use 묻다 for ask, the conjugation is irregular. However, when you use it for bury, it's regular. Let's see with examples. 

국현이한테 물어 보자. 
Let's ask 국현. 

어제 온 사람이 누구인지 물었는데 대답을 안 하더라고. 
I asked him about the person who came here yesterday, but he didn't answer.

She took out the gold nugget she buried in the ground.
