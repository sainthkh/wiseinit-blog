The 4th irregular verb group is 르 irregular. Some of you might think that I tried to say ㄹ irregular. No. It's 르 irregular. Verbs we will learn today have the character 르 in them. 

Like other rules, irregular conjugation happens when markers or endings that start with vowels are appended after 르. In 르 irregular, every stem ends with 르. So, when we conjugate endings or markers that start with 으 like 으면, 으니, 으니까, 을, we should get rid of "으" part from the markers and endings when you conjugate because the stem ends with vowel. So, it's not 모르으면, 모르으니, 모르을, they should be 모르면, 모르니, 모를. 

One more difference is when the endings or markers that start with 어/아 like 았/었 or 아서/어서 are appended. When 르 meets them, 르 will change into 랐/렀, 라서/러서. The choice between 라 and 러 is determined by vowel harmony. When the character in front of 르 has a vowel, ㅏ or ㅗ, then you should choose 라. When the character in front of 르 has a vowel, ㅓ, ㅜ, ㅡ, or ㅣ, then you should choose 러. So, it's not 몰렀다, 골렀다, 날러서, they should be 몰랐다, 골랐다, 날라서. It's another case of vowel contraction. 

In addition, you might have noticed that ㄹ is added to the character in front of 르. That's why it is called ㄹ irregular.
