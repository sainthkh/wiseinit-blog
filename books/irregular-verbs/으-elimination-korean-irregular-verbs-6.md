When you read the title of this episode, you might have thought that it's a bit odd. You cannot find "irregular" in the title. It's because 으 elimination is a regular conjugation with a special rule. 

When the verbs whose stem ends with ㅡ like 쓰다, 따르다, 바쁘다 meet 아/어, then ㅡ is eliminated like 썼다, 따라서, 바빠도, etc. 

Actually, you've learned this rule in 르 irregular. When 아/어 is appended to 르 irregular verbs, ㅡ is eliminated and 르 becomes 라/러 like 눌렀다, 날랐다, 몰라도 etc. 

This vowel compression always happens when 아/어 are after 으. So, this rule is called 으 elimination. It's a regular conjugation with the change of verb stem, so I've cover it with irregular verbs, because the stems of normal regular verbs aren't changed. 

Example Verbs: 쓰다(use, write), 따르다(pour, follow), 잠그다(close), 담그다(put your hand or foot into the water, make kimchi), 끄다(turn off), 뜨다(float, take off)
Example Descriptive Verbs: 고프다(hungry), 기쁘다( glad, pleased), 바쁘다(busy), 슬프다(sad), 아프다(painful, sick), 쓰다(bitter)
