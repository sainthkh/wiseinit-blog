Today, we'll learn another regular conjugation. It's ㄹ regular. In some conditions, the 받침 ㄹ in the stem of words are eliminated. 

##  Rule 1.

When they are conjugated with some endings like -ㄴ, -ㄹ, -네, -ㅂ니다, -시-, 받침 ㄹ is eliminated. For example, the conjugation of the verb, 날다(fly), is 난, 날, 나네, 납니다, 나신다, etc. 

The problem with this rule is that it happens only with some consonant endings. For example, if we conjugate 날다 with -지, it's not 나지, but 날지.

##  Rule 2. 

When they are conjugated with some endings that start with "으" like 으려고, 으면, "으" is eliminated. For example, the conjugation of the verb, 날다, is 날려고, 날면.

##  Rule 3. 

Finally, the combination of Rule 1 and Rule 2. When they are conjugated with endings like 으니, 으니까, "으" and ㄹ are eliminated. For example, the conjugated version of 날다 is 나니까, 나니. 

Verbs: 날다(fly), 알다(know), 울다(cry), 놀다(play, hang out), 불다(blow), 갈다(change), 멀다(far away), 달다(sweet), 길다(long), 둥글다(round, circular), 어질다(kind, benevolent)
