We will finish our long journey of irregular verbs today. The final irregular verb rule is 러 irregular. 

When endings 어도, 어서, 었 is appended to some verbs that end with 르, 어도, 어서, 었 are changed to 러, 러서, 렀. 

When you heard the character 르, you might have remembered the 르 irregular. Yes, 러 irregular is another form of irregular after 르 verbs. The difference is that in 르 irregular, ㄹ is added to word stem and 르 is eliminated. In contrast, in 러 irregular, just 러, 러서, 렀 is appended after 르. 

Fortunately, there are only two verbs in Korean that have 러 irregular. They are 이르다(arrive) and 푸르다(blue, green). 

Some of you might have remembered 이르다 in 르 irregular. Like 묻다, the conjugation of 이르다 is changed according to its meaning. When you use 이르다 as early or tell, report, 이르다 uses 르 irregular. However, when you use 이르다 for arrive, then you should use 러 irregular. 

#  Examples. 

공항에 이르렀을 때 친구를 만났다. 
When I arrived at the airport, I met a friend of mine. 

동생이 내가 한 일을 전부 엄마한테 일렀다. 
My younger brother reported everything I did to my mom.

너무 일렀나? 사람이 하나도 없네. 
Is it too early? No one is here. 

하늘이 푸르러도 전혀 기쁘지 않았다. 
The sky was blue, but I was not happy at all. 

하늘은 맑고 산은 푸르렀다. 
The sky was clear and the mountain was green. 

Actually, there is one more verb that use 러 irregular. It's 누르다. It doesn't mean push. It means yellow. But it's almost dead word, so I removed it in the examples.
