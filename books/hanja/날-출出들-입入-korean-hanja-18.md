We've learned the characters for inside and outside. They were 안 내(內) and 바깥 외(外). There is no movement in the meanings of these characters. They are just static. Today, we will learn the characters that involve movement. They are 날 출(出) and 들 입(入). They each mean going out and coming in. Let's learn more about the characters one by one.

#  수출(輸出)/수입(輸入)

These days, many countries sell what they have made and buy what other countries have made. These are called export and import in English and 수출 and 수입 in Korean. 수 here means to send. When exporting and importing products, we send them from one nation to the other. That's why 수입 and 수출 got this meaning.

수출보다 수입이 줄어드는 속도가 더 빨라서 계속 흑자가 이어지고 있다.
As the decreasing speed of import is faster than export, the surplus is still going on.

Sometimes, these export and import are used in some software. They are not called 수입, 수출 there. They are usually called 내보내기, 들여오기.

#  입구(入口)/출구(出口)

입구 is the word for entrance and 출구 is the word for exit. 구 here basically means mouth. As the doors look like mouth, 구 is sometimes used for doors.

이 건물은 특이하게 입구와 출구가 따로 있다.
This building has entrance and exit separately. It's a bit weird.

In subway systems in 수도권(near Seoul) of Korea, there are many stations that end with 입구. They are entrances of universities. Actually, it usually takes more than you think to enter the university from that station. Although there is a word 입구 in their names, there is no entrance near gates. You have to walk long to get there. Sometimes, it is too far to walk from the station to the university. 서울대 입구역 is the best example for this.

By the way, the gates of the subway stations are called 출구. Gate number 4 is called 4번 출구.

서울대 입구역 4번 출구에서 보도록 하자.
Let's meet at gate no. 4 in Seoul National University Station.

When entrance and exit are same, it is called 출입구. It is a combined word of 출구 and 입구. As there is no word like entrance-exit in English, native speakers of English use either entrance or exit, but Korean use 출입구 a lot.

무슨 일인지, 아파트 출입구에 수많은 사람들이 모여 있다.
I cannot figure out why, but there are so many people in front of the apartment entrance.

It is not related with 출 and 구, but emergency exit or fire exit is 비상구.

#  입국(入國)/출국(出國)

When you go out of a nation, then it is 출국. When you move into a nation, it is 입국. 국 here means nation.

드라마 촬영을 위해 출국한 그 배우는 6개월이 지나서야 입국했다.
The actor who left Korea for the TV series came back after the 6 months.

#  입원(入院)/퇴원(退院), 입대(入隊)/제대(除隊), 전역(轉役)

Like 고 and 저, or 초 and 말, the antonyms of a word are sometimes unintuitive. 출 and 입 are not the exception.

입원 means to be hospitalized, but leaving the hospital is not 출원, it is 퇴원. 퇴 here means retreat.
Joining the army is 입대 as you enter the army, 군대. However, the discharge from the army is not 출대, it is 제대 or 전역. 제 in 제대 means eliminate.

입원한지 40일만에 퇴원했다.
He left the hospital after 40 days.

입대 후 벌써 21개월이 지나 그는 전역했다.
21 months have already passed after his joining the army. He is discharged.
