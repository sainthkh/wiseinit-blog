In Korean children's songs, there is something like this.

"사, 사, 사 자로 끝나는 말은? 역사, 회사, 인사, 조사, 장사, 행사."

Any character can be used in the place of 사. I don't know who made this song, but it is good for children to learn new words.

Today's character is 사. Unlike other previous lessons, we will learn the characters whose sound is 사 at the end of the names of jobs. In Korea, many people think that jobs that end with 사 are good because they are mostly professional and those who have those jobs earn a lot of money. Then, let's see the words.

#  일 사(事)

일 사(事) means the work or case. This character is used in jobs like 판사 and 검사.

판사(判事) means judge in courts. 판 here means decide or judgement. Judges decide who is correct and who is wrong in cases.

검사(檢事) means prosecutor or attorney. 검 here means examine, inspect, check. As you know, prosecutors inspect and prosecute cases.

I guess that the character, 일 사, is used for those jobs because 판사s and 검사s work to solve cases.

그는 한 때 유명한 판사였다.
He was once a famous judge.

그녀는 검사라는 자신의 직업에 자부심을 가지고 있다.
She is proud of her job, prosecutor.

#  스승 사(師)

스승 사(師) means teachers. 스승 is a bit old fashioned way of calling teachers. You can listen to that word in historical movies or TV series.

The most famous and obvious word that uses 스승 사 is 교사(敎師). It means teacher and 교 here means to teach.

This 사 is also used in 목사(牧師), pastor or minister who teaches in churches. 목 here means raising animals. It is the same 목 used in 목자(牧者), shepherd or 목장(牧場), farm or ranch.

Interestingly, 스승 사 is also used for doctors and nurses. They are 의사(醫師) and 간호사(看護師). 의 means doctor and 간 means watch and 호 means protect.

그는 교사가 되기 위해 열심히 공부하고 있다.
He is studying hard to be a doctor.

저는 간호사가 아니라 의사입니다.
I am a doctor, not a nurse.

#  선비 사(士)

Our final character is 선비 사(士). 선비s are the scholars in ancient Korea. It is used in some jobs which usually need licenses.

변호사(辯護士) is lawyer. 변 means talking or words. 호 means protect. It is the same 호 in 간호사. Lawyers protect their clients with their words.

세무사(稅務士) is accountant. 세 means tax and 무 means work. Accountants do the tedious tax works for us.

사업할 때 모든 것을 알 수 없으니, 변호사와 세무사의 도움을 받는 것이 좋다.
As you cannot know everything when you are doing your business, it is good for you to get help from lawyers and accountants.

#  It is hard to guess…

Although we learned those words, it is meaningless to know exactly which character is used in each job. I made this episode to tell you the jobs that end with 사 and 3 helpful hanja characters, not to help you discern them in job names.

In addition, it is really hard to guess the character from the job sometimes. The example is 요리사 and 영양사.

요리사(料理師) is cook and 영양사(營養士) is nutritionist, or dietician. Although those two jobs are related with foods, 요리사 uses 스승 사 and 영양사 uses 선비 사. It is hard to guess why they are like these.

넌 영양사가 되고 싶은 거겠지만, 난 요리사가 되고 싶어.
You might want to be a nutritionist, but I want to be a cook.

#  프로듀사?

You might have heard of the Korean TV series, Producer. Its original name is not 프로듀서, but 프로듀사. It got this name because it used the ambiguity of the word. It is the combination of the word, 프로듀서 and the character, 일 사(事) we just learned. In the series, the father of the main character says that we also have a son who has the job whose name ends with 사 and he calls 프로듀서 as 프로듀사. 프로듀사 came from this phrase and it also means the works of producers, which is the main theme of the series.
