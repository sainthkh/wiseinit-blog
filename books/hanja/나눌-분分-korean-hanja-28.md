When some work is really big, it is a good idea to crack the work down and solve them one by one. The character we will learn today is related with this cracking. It is 나눌 분(分).

#  Divide

The first meaning of 나눌 분 is to divide.

분업(分業) means division of labor. We learned 업 before and it is about work. So 분업 means division of works or labor.
분배(分排) means distribute or share. 배 here also means divide.
분단(分斷) means divided or partitioned. When you say Korea is the divided nation, the word 분단 is used like 분단 국가.

분업을 하면 훨씬 더 많은 일을 할 수 있어.
If you divide your labor, you can do more works.

이 일로 인해 얻게 된 소득은 공평하게 분배하도록 하자.
Let's equally share the profit we got from this work.

#  Part

After something is divided, there are some parts left behind. Because of that, the word that has 분 sometimes means parts of something.

분야(分野) is professional field. 야 means field.
분량(分量) is amount or quantity. 량 means quantity.
부분(部分) is part. 부 means herd or group. When you say most of people, it is said 대부분의 사람들 in Korean. 대 here means big.

내가 일하는 분야에서는 그런 사건이 흔해.
In my field, the case like that is usual.

내게 할당된 분량이 네게 할당된 것보다 많아.
The amount allowed to me is more than yours.

#  Category

When you divide something into same groups, then you categorized them. Because of that, 분 sometimes means category.

분석(分析) means analysis. 석 means crack something. When you analyze, you should crack it down.
분류(分類) is classification or categorization. 류 here means category, kind or sort.

분석 결과가 나왔습니다.
The analysis came out.

이것들을 분류해 보니 특이한 것이 하나 있습니다.
After classifying them, I found something interesting.

#  Other

There are some words that it is hard to guess why 분 is there. I added them here because these 2 words are frequently used.

The first word is 기분(氣分). It is how you feel or your mood. 기 here means atmosphere.
The second word is 덕분(德分). It is used in the form of 덕분에 a lot. It means "thanks to." 덕 here means good deeds.

기분이 안 좋다고 해서 일도 제대로 안 하면 안 돼.
Even if you don't feel well, you should finish your work well.

네 덕분에 일 잘 마쳤다. 고맙다.
Thanks to you, I could finish it well. Thank you.
