From today, we will learn 한자s. The first 한자s we will learn are 유(有) and 무(無). Both characters are antonyms of each other. 유(有) means there is and 무(無) means there is not.

Let's learn more about these words in more detail.

#  유식/무식

When someone knows a lot of things, he is called to be 유식 in Korean. As 식(識) in 유식 means knowledge, 유식 means you have a lot of knowledge, so it means educated, intelligent, learned. In contrast, 무식 means you don't have any knowledge, so it means ignorant or idiotic.

그런 것도 알아? 엄청 유식하네.
Did you know something like that? You are really intelligent.

무식한 척 하지 마. 알고 있는 것 다 아니까.
Stop pretending to be idiotic. I know that you know it.

#  유명/무명

명(名) means name. 유명 means your name exists. If your name exists everywhere, you are famous. That's why 유명하다 means to be famous. 무명 means there is no name. If your name is nowhere, then you are not famous, or unknown.

그는 요즘도 자신이 무명 시절일 때 촬영한 영상들을 본다고 한다.
It is said that he even now watches the films he took when he was unknown.

유명해지는 것이 꼭 좋은 것은 아니야.
It is not always good to be famous.

#  유료/무료

료(料) means to count. We count our moneys a lot, so 료 got the meaning of money. 유료 means there is money, so you have to pay to use something. 무료 means no money, so it means free. It is a synonym of 공짜.

If you visit Steam, or App Store, you can find some games labeled "free to play." Actually, it means free to start, but you have to pay on the go if you want to be great at this game. It is called 부분 유료화 in Korean. The word by word translation is partially paid game.

그렇게 좋은 책이 무료라고?
Did you say that the good book like that is free?

#  More Words

Let's see more words with 유 and 무. In grammar jargons, there are 유성음 and 무성음. 유성음 means vocal sounds like g, j, d, m, 무성음 means voiceless sounds like k, ch, t. 성(聲) means voice and 음(音) means sound, then you can guess what these words mean.

Sometimes, they are used like prefixes. 유경험자 and 무경험자 are examples. 유 and 무 are added to the word, 경험자, an experienced person. 유경험자 means a person who has an experience and 무경험자 means not.
