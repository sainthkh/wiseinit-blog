If we hear the word, gold, it reminds us many things like money, pretty, glittering, etc. The character, 금(金) has many meanings. We will learn one by one.

#  금 as money

One of the many words that people think when they heard the word, gold, is money. It is also true in Korea. Because of that, it means money when 금 is used.

세금(稅金) is tax as 세 means tax.
현금(現金) is cash as 현 means real.
금액(金額) is sum of money as 액 means count.
벌금(罰金) is fine as 벌 means penalty.

가지고 있는 현금을 세금을 내는데 다 내 버렸다.
I used all of my cash to pay my taxes.

결국 벌금을 내고야 말았다.
I finally paid the penalty.

총 금액은 30만원이었다. 이 돈을 어디서 구할지 고민이다.
The sum was 300,000 won. I am considering where to get it.

#  금 in banking words

As banks hold our money, 금 is used a lot in bank words.

예금(預金) is keep or deposit because 예 means in advance or keep.
입금(入金) also means deposit because 입 means to come in.
저금(貯金) is saving because 저 means to stack up or store.
출금(出金) means withdraw because 출 means to go out.
적금(積金) means installment savings because 적 means stacking.

Both 예금 and 입금 have the same meaning, but they are used in different contexts. 예금 is usually used with 계좌 meaning account. 입금 is used when you deposit your money. When you visit bank and deposit money, it is written on the paper like 예금하실 금액.

은행에 예금 계좌를 하나 만들었다.
I made a bank account.

3년간 적금 들었던 돈을 찾아왔다.
I brought back the money I deposited with installment savings.

입금할 돈은 없고 출금할 돈만 생기는구나.
I don't have any money to deposit, but only have money to withdraw.

#  금 as metal

When Koreans memorize 한자s, they first speak the meaning and sound next. It is like this, 하늘 천(天), 땅 지(地). When reading 금 like this, it is 쇠 금 and 쇠 means metal. Due to that, you can find some words with 금 meaning metal like 금속, 합금.

금속(金屬) is the word for metal. It means all kinds of metal, gold, steel, aluminum, etc. 속 means kind or sort.
합금(合金) is alloy. 합 means combine or combination. As alloys are the combination of multiple metal, 합금 is alloy.

신제품에 어떤 금속을 사용해야 할지 조사하는 중입니다.
I am now researching which metal we should use for our next product.

청동은 구리와 주석의 합금이다.
Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc.

#  김

When 금 is used for family names, it should be read as 김, not 금. As you know, it is the most common family name in Korea.

Because of these 2 meanings, when Yuna Kim(김연아) got the gold medal in Vancouver Winter Olympics, some newspapers wrote name like 金연아. It is a kind of word play as she got the gold(金) medal and her family name is 김(金).
