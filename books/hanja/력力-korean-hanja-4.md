To complete works, we need various abilities. We sometimes need physical powers. In other times, we need intellectual abilities. In the words of those abilities, the character, 력(力), is used a lot.

The basic meaning of 력 is 힘, power. It is naturally used to describe physical power of a person. In addition, it is used to describe variety of abilities. Let's see one by one.

#  능력/노력

능(能) means able, so 능력 means some powers that make you be able to do something. That's why it got the meaning, ability. Some superpowers that many superheroes in the movies or cartoons have are called 초능력 in Korean. 초(超) here means exceeding. The basic meaning of 초능력 is the ability that exceeds the basic abilities of normal people, so it's a super power.

노(努) means using your power. 노력 is using your power and ability. In other words, it is putting some effort, so 노력 is effort, exertion, endeavor.

능력을 키우기 위해서는 노력을 해야 해.
You should make an effort to improve your abilities.

능력이 부족한 것이 아니라 노력이 부족한 거야.
It was because of the lack of your effort, not because of your ability.

#  체력/정신력

체(體) means body. 체력 is the power of your body, so it is strength or stamina. 정신 means your mind, spirit, or soul. 정신력 is the power of your body, or willpower, mental strength.

체력보다 중요한 것은 정신력이야.
Your mental strength is more important than your physical strength.

#  력 as suffix

If you find 력 in Naver dictionary, you can find 2484 words. It is impossible to cover all of them, so I will tell you what the word means if 력 is added as suffix.

When 력 is added as a suffix, it usually adds the meaning "an ability to do something." Let's see some examples.

이해 is understanding. 이해력 is the ability to understand something.
사고 is thinking. 사고력 is the ability to think.
Sometimes, 력 is added to some English words. One of the examples is jump. 점프력 is the ability to jump.
영향 is an influence. 영향력 is the ability to be influential to others.
경쟁 is competition. 경쟁력 is the ability to compete with others.

이 프로그램은 아이들의 이해력과 사고력 발달에 많은 도움을 줍니다.
This program is helpful for kids to develop their abilities to understand and think.

우리 회사의 영향력을 확대하려면, 우리 제품의 경쟁력을 향상시켜야 합니다.

#  Other words.

Many gaming words have 력 in it. 체력 is health point or HP. 마법력 is magic point or MP, 마법 here is magic. 순발력(瞬發力) is agility. 순 means short period of time and 발 means shoot.

전력(電力) means electricity. 전 means thunder.

All of the words in our examples had 력 as their last character. It is hard to find 력 in the first or middle place of a word. Some examples I could find were 역도(力道), weightlifting, 역학(力學), dynamics you learn in physics class, 역량(力量), capability or competence.
