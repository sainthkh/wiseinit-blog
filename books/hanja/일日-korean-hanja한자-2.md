The character we will learn today is 일(日). The first meaning of 일 is the sun in the sky and the second meaning, day or date, is derived from it. It is a bit similar with the English word, day. Its basic meaning is the period when sun is on the sky, which is 낮 in Korean. However, as we work when the sun is up, so it also means a date or 24 hours, which is 하루 in Korean. They both have same derivation.

#  When 일 means sun.


#  일출/일몰

일출 means sunrise and 일몰 means sunset because 출(出) means out and 몰(沒) means drowning. 일출 is out of the sun and 일몰 is drowning of the sun.

어제 일출은 5:10, 일몰은 19:53이었다.
Yesterday, the sunrise was 5:10, the sunset was 19:53.

#  일상

As 일 means day or date, it can also be used to call daily routine. It is 일상 in Korean. 상(常) means always. It is the same 상 in 항상 which means always in Korean. If you always do it daily, then it is your daily routine, so 일상 means daily routine or daily life.

이제 다시 일상으로 돌아갈 시간이다.
Now, it's to time to be back to daily routine.

일상에서 벗어나 뭔가 다른 것을 해 보고 싶다.
I just want to get out of this daily routine and do something different.

#  일정

When we make plans, we arrange what we want or have to do and limit our time to do something. Plans are not physical path, but it surely is a mental path to the goal. 일정 is used to call plan, schedule, or itinerary as 정(程) means limit or path.

No matter how busy we are, we should follow the schedule.

일정을 짜 놓긴 했는데, 많이 바뀌겠지?
I made the plan, but it will be changed a lot, won't it?

여행 일정이 어떻게 되지?
Can you tell me about the itinerary?

#  일보/일간지

There are 3 newspapers in Korea which end with 일보. They are 조선일보, 중앙일보, 동아일보. Many people call them as 조중동 by combining their first characters. They are famous for their conservative views. 일보 in their names mean daily report as 보(報) means pay back or report.

These daily newspapers are called 일간지 in Korean. 간(刊) means publish. 지(紙) means paper. The basic meaning of 일간지 is daily published paper and it means daily newspapers. Weekly newspapers are 주간지 and monthly ones are 월간지. 주(週) means week, and 월(月) means moon and month.

조선일보는 1920년에 창간되었다. 100년이 다 되어 간다.
조선일보 was first published in 1920. Almost 100 years have been passed since then.
