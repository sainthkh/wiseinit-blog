When most native speakers of Korean see the word, Korea, they only think about the South Korea. However, to most people in the world, there are 2 Koreas, South Korea and North Korea. 

In this web book, I've covered topics about North Korea like "why 2 Koreas are separated", "the economy and life in North Korea", "the provocation of North Korea", etc.
