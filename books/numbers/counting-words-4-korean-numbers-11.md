#  채

채 is used to count houses. 

그는 집을 세 채나 가지고 있다.
He even has 3 houses. 

집 한 채 장만하는 것이 쉽지 않구나. 
It is hard to buy a house. 

In dictionary, it is said that 채 is also used to count blankets(이불) and wardrobe(장롱). Personally, I've never heard someone using 채 for them. So, it's a bit awkward to me. However, it's written in the dictionaries and it is possible that you will meet someone who uses 채 for them. Do not think that it's wrong. 

#  알

알 is used to count small and round objects like beans(콩), pills(알약), etc. 

이 약은 매일 한 알씩 드시면 됩니다. 
Please eat one pill a day. 

콩 한 알이 떨어졌는데, 어디로 갔는지 모르겠네.
I dropped a bean on the floor. I don't know where it's gone. 

#  대

대 is used to count vehicles like car(차), bus(버스), motorcycles(오토바이), etc. 

지금 앞에 사고가 나서 차들이 다 천천히 가고 있다. 
There is an accident ahead, so cars are moving slowly. 

대 is also used to count eletronic devices like computer(컴퓨터), TV, monitor(모니터), AC(에어컨), fridge(냉장고), smart phones(스마트폰), etc. 

며칠 전에 컴퓨터가 고장이 나서 한 대 새로 샀다. 
A few days ago, my computer became out of order, so I bought a new one. 


#  살/세

살 and 세 are used to count ages. 살 is used a lot in conversations and 세 is used a lot in documents. 

세 살 버릇 여든까지 간다. 
Habit you learned at 3 won't die until 80. 
What is learned in the cradle is carried to the tomb. 

지원 조건이 30세 미만이라는데?
In the condition for the application, it says that you should be under 30.


#  분

분 is used to count people. It's a polite language for 명. When you should use polite Korean, 분 sounds better than 명. 

총 다섯 분이신 거죠?
It's 5 of you. Right?

원래는 세 분 오시기로 했는데, 두 분만 오셨어. 
Originally, 3 people were to come, but only 2 of them came.
