We've learned every grammar related to numbers. From today, we'll learn the counting words with examples. 

#  마리

마리 is used to count the number of animals like cats(고양이), dogs(개), cattle(소), mouse(쥐), dragon fly(잠자리), 개미(ant), etc. 

친구가 고양이 한 마리를 선물해 주었다. 
My friend gave me a cat as a present. 

길에 참새 여러 마리가 죽어 있었어. 
There were a few sparrows dead on the road. 


#  그루

그루 is used to count the number of trees. 

이 숲의 나무가 몇 그루인지 정확히 맞추는 사람은 왕의 사위가 될 것이오. 
The person who counts the number of trees in this forest correctly will be a son-in-law of the king. 

여기 커다란 나무가 한 그루 있었던 것 같은데. 아니었나?
I thought that a big tree was near here. Wasn't it?


#  곳

If you want to count the number of places, use 곳 or 군데. These 2 words have the same meaning. However, 곳 is a bit politer than 군데. 

서너 곳 정도 가 봤는데 아무데도 없었어. 
I went to 3 or 4 places but there was nothing. 

쇼핑몰 여러 군데의 가격을 한 눈에 비교할 수 있어.
You can compare the prices of many shopping malls with a single view. 


#  송이

When counting flowers, use 송이. 

장미꽃 99송이면 얼마야?
As for 99 roses, how much are they?

5월은 가정의 달이라서 한 송이에 몇 천원씩 해. 
May is the month for families, so a single flower even costs several thousand won.

In this sentence, there is no flower or flower name. However, from the word, 송이, we can guess it is about flowers. 

It was a bit old drama, but in 별에서 온 그대, the name of the main character was 천송이. So, she did a rap with her own name like "내 이름은 천송이, 우리 언니 만 송이, 내 동생 백 송이". 천 is a thousand, 백 is a hundred, 만 is ten thousand. It's a word pun.

#  장

장 is used to count the number of paper sheets. Sometimes, 매 is used to count paper sheets. You can see 매 on the cover of some A4 boxes like 5000매, 5000 sheets. 매 is not used in conversations. 

한 장만 쓰려고 했는데 쓰다 보니 열 장이 넘어갔다. 
I wanted to write a single page, but it became more than 10 pages as I wrote it. 

그게 마지막 장인 줄 알았는데, 더 있었다. 
I firstly thought that it was the last sheet, but there were more.
