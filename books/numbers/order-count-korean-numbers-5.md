In many counting words, you should use only Sino-Korean numbers or pure Korean numbers. As we've learned, this number reading rule usually changes when the number is over 20. 

However, in some words, the meaning becomes different when you use Sino-Korean numbers or pure Korean numbers. These words are 번, 층, 동, 권, 편, 화. 

When you use the Sino-Korean numbers with these numbers, it means the order or the name. When using pure Korean numbers, it means the number of repetition or count of something. Let's see them with examples. 

#  번

When you use 번 with pure Korean numbers, it means the count of action. 

이 책을 지금까지 다섯 번 봤는데 아직도 무슨 말인지 모르겠어. 
I've read this book for 5 times, but I cannot still understand it. 

열 번 정도 도전해 보니까 되더라고. 
I've tried it almost 10 times, then I succeeded. 

In many things or people, we call them by numbers. These numbers are read by Sino-Korean numbers. 

276번 학생 들어 오세요. 
Student no. 276. Please come in. 

6번부터 10번까지 다 틀렸다. 
From question number 6 to number 10, I've answered all wrong. 


#  층

층 is used to call stories or floors of building. When you use pure Korean numbers with 층, it means the number of floors in the building. 

세 층 정도 위에서 나는 소리를 어떻게 들었어?
How did you hear the sound from the 3 floors above?

다섯 층씩이나 걸어가야 한다고?
Do I have to walk up 5 floors?

Like others, when you use Sino-Korean numbers, it means the number of the floor. 

우리 집은 17층에 있다. 
My house is in the 17th floor. 

2층이라 엘리베이터가 안 선다. 
It's in the 2nd floor, so the elevator doesn't stop here. 

The floor numbering system in Korea is identical to US. In UK, the 1st floor is the ground floor and the 2nd floor is the 1st floor and so on. There is no ground floor in Korean. 


#  동

동 is used to call the building. When you use pure Korean numbers with 동, it means the count of buildings. 

이 연구소는 여섯 동으로 되어 있다. 
In this lab, there are 6 buildings. 

이 아파트 단지에서 두 동은 여기에 있고, 나머지 두 동은 길 건너에 있어요.
In this apartment block, 2 buildings are here and other 2 buildings are across the road. 

In some buildings, there are special names like Carnegie hall, Empire States Building, etc. However, in many buildings, we call them by numbers or alphabet characters. When you call these numbered buildings, you should use Sino-Korean numbers. 

307동 옆에는 초등학교가 하나 있다. 
Next to building 307, there is an elementary school. 

6동이랑 8동은 붙어 있는데, 7동은 나중에 다시 지어져서 저 멀리 있어. 
Building 6 and 8 are next to each other, but 7 is rebuilt later, so it is far from here.
