#  다발

When you count flowers as bouquets, you can use the word, 다발. When you use 다발, flowers should be tied. Otherwise, you should use 송이.

이 장미 꽃 한 다발에 얼마에요?
How much are the roses as a bouquet?

내일 여자친구에게 선물로 줄 꽃을 한 다발 샀다. 
I've bought a bouquet to give it to my girlfriend tomorrow. 

The word for bouquet in Korean, 꽃다발, came from this noun. 


#  묶음

묶다 means to tie. Except flowers, you should use 묶음 for tied objects.

여기 배추 한 묶음 주세요. 
A bundle of cabbages here. 

버릴 책을 세 묶음으로 나누었다. 하루에 한 묶음씩 버릴 생각이다. 
I've tied the unnecessary books in 3 bundles. I will throw them away one bundle a day. 


#  판

판 usually means a board. As we all know, there are 30 eggs on a tray. So, it means 30 eggs. Sometimes, you can find 10, 12, or 20 eggs in a tray. However, usually, if you bought 계란 한 판, it means 30. Because of that, some Koreans use this phrase to call themselves when they become 30. 

계란 한 판 사면 한 달은 먹던가?
If we buy a tray of eggs, do we eat them in a month?

Traditionally, games were played on boards. So, when you play a game, Koreans use the word, 판. 

게임 한 판만 하고 갈게. 
I will follow you after playing a set of game.

윷놀이 한 판 어때?
How about playing a set of 윷놀이?

#  다스

다스 is dozen. It seems that it came from Japanese. It means 12 in Korean, too. However, you should only use it with pencils or pens in Korean. When you buy pencils or pens a lot, you should buy dozens of them at a time. 

고등학교 때 산 연필 한 다스가 아직도 있다. 
I still have the dozen of pencils I bought when I was in high school.
