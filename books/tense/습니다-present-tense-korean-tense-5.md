Finally, it's time for the present tense 습니다 ending. 습니다 is the most polite way of speaking something. That's why it sounds something too official and formal. So, it is not used much in conversation. In addition, although they changed the rule recently, you cannot use "-요" in armies. Therefore, if you use it too much, you might sound like soldiers. 

#  Basic form

The rule for 습니다 ending is to add just 습니다 after stems that end with a consonant except ㄹ like 읽습니다, 잡습니다. And add -ㅂ니다 after ㄹ and vowels like 삽니다, 갑니다, 옵니다. 

저는 기숙사에 삽니다. 
I live in the dormitory.

동생은 영어를 공부합니다. 
My younger brother is studying English. 

매일 저녁 신문을 읽습니다. 
I read newspapers every evening. 

#  Question Form

When you want to ask something in this form, just add 으십니까 after stems that end with a consonant except ㄹ like 읽으십니까, 잡으십니까. And add just 습니까 after ㄹ and vowels like 사십니까, 가십니까, 오십니까. Like always, the ending starts with a vowel, "으", so you should be careful about the irregular verbs. 

Actually, these -(으)십니까 form is the combination of 습니까 and -시- ending. You can conjugate them like 읽습니까, 삽니까, 갑니까, etc. But they sound unnatural and somewhat rude. This form is used when higher-rank people want to be polite to someone in lower rank. It also sounds a bit like interrogation or questioning.
