Last week, we've learned future tense ending for 반말. This week, we'll learn 존댓말 endings. 

# -을게요/-ㄹ게요

There are 2 conversational polite endings, -을게요/-ㄹ게요 and -ㄹ/을 거예요. Both of them are similar but have a little different nuance. 

As for -을게요/-ㄹ게요, it is used when you want to do something. It's 존댓말 version of -을게/-ㄹ게.

지금부터는 제가 할게요.
From now on, I'll do that. 

아까 못한 게 있어서 이따가 이어서 할게요.
There are some works I couldn't finish, so I'll continue them later. 

남은 것은 집에 가져가서 먹을게요.
I'll eat the rest when I go back home. 

Like -을게/-ㄹ게, "I" is included in the sentence, so you should not use -을게요/-ㄹ게요 with second or third person like 지금부터는 네가 할게요 or 아까 못한 게 있어서 이따가 민호가 이어서 할게요. 

# -ㄹ/을 거예요

-ㄹ/을 거예요 ending is the 존댓말 version of -ㄹ/을 거야. Like its 반말 counterpart, -ㄹ/을 거예요 can be used with second and third person. In addition, if it is used with the first person, it shows the strong will of the speaker. 

영희가 실수한 거는 철수가 곧 수습할 거예요.
The mistakes 영희 made will be handled by 철수 soon. 

내일 저녁에는 영화를 보러 갈 거예요.
I'll go see a movie tomorrow evening. 

One thing you should know is that many native Koreans write 거예요 as 거에요. Although 거예요 is grammatically correct, many Koreans pronounce it like 거에요 and think that it is correct.

One thing I didn't mention in the last episode was that you cannot use -ㄹ게/-을게/-ㄹ게요/-을게요 ending for expectation. If you want to talk about your expectation, you must use -ㄹ/을 거야/거예요.

그 아이들이라면 지금쯤 서울에 가 있을 거예요.
Those kids might be in Seoul right now. 

내일이라면 완성될 거예요.
It'll be finished tomorrow. 

# -겠습니다, -ㄹ/을 것입니다

Finally, -습니다 ending. Like others, there are 2 endings like -겠습니다 and -ㄹ/을 것입니다. You can use them for same purposes. -겠습니다 is for the speaker's will, desire. -ㄹ/을 것입니다 is for second and third person and your guess or expectation.

여기부터는 제가 하겠습니다. 
I'll do this from here. 

1시간 후에는 모두 모여 있을 것입니다. 
After an hour, everyone will be here. 

이번에는 꼭 우승할 것입니다. 
We'll win this time.
