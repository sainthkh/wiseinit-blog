Last week, we've learned when future tense forms are used. This week, we'll learn how to conjugate them. We'll cover various endings for 반말 versions this week and 존댓말 versions for next week. 

# -ㄹ게/-을게

First ending is -ㄹ게/-을게, -ㄹ 거야/-을 거야. These forms are 반말 version of future tense forms. Like always, just conjugate them after the verbs. As they start with vowels, you should be careful for the irregular verbs. 

거기는 내가 갈게.
I'll go there.

그건 내가 처리할게.
I'll handle that. 

One thing to note about the -ㄹ게/-을게 form is that you should only use them for the first person. It means that you should not use it for second or third person. So, it is wrong to speak like this. 

거기는 네가 갈게. / 거기는 철수가 갈게.
그건 네가 처리할게. / 그건 영희가 처리할게. 

When Koreans pronounce -ㄹ게/-을게, they usually pronounce 게 as 께. Because of this, many Koreans don't know that 게 is standard and usually write them as 께 like 할께, 먹을께, 잘께, etc. It's one of the most common mistakes of native speakers. 

# -ㄹ 거야/-을 거야

For second and third person, you should use -ㄹ 거야/-을 거야 form. 거야 here is the shortened form of 것이야. But almost no one uses this in daily conversation. 

그 행사는 철수가 참여할 거야. 
철수 will attend that event. 

그 방에 들어가면 깜깜해서 많이 두려울 거야. 조심해. 
When you enter the room, you might be scared because it's dark inside. Be careful. 

Actually, you can use that -ㄹ 거야/-을 거야 form for the first person. However, when you use them, it implies that you really want it. You're showing your strong will. The listener might think that you are trying to do that no matter what. 

나는 햄버거 안 먹을 거야. 
I won't eat the hamburger no matter what. 

케익은 내가 만들 거야. 
I'll make the cake no matter what. 

# -ㄹ 것이다/-을 것이다

Written form of future tense is -ㄹ 것이다/-을 것이다. -겠다 is not usually used for the written form. 

꾸준히 하면 성공할 수 있을 것이다. 
If you do it continuously, you can make a success. 

철수는 지금쯤 부산에 갔을 것이다. 
By now, 철수 might have started to go to 부산. 

내일은 아무도 오지 않을 것이다. 
No one will come tomorrow. 

# -겠다 for conversation.

Interestingly, the -겠다 form is usually used in spoken Korean for envy, guess, expectation. 

좋겠다. 나도 그거 좋아하는데. 
I envy you. I love that, too. 

12시니까 지금 쯤이면 도착했겠다. 
It's noon. They might have arrived. 

그렇게 불평하지 않고 그냥 했으면 벌써 끝났겠다. 
If you have done without complaints, it must have finished.
