Let's learn how to conjugate verbs for the past tenses. Like always, there are 4 types of conjugations, 았/었어, 았/었다, 았/었어요, 았/었습니다. As all of them start with 어, you should be careful with irregular verbs. 

Like always, the choice of 았/었 is determined by vowel harmony. If the character in front of 았/었 has ㅏ or ㅗ, then it should be 았. For the rest, it should be 었.

We'll see each type with 3 examples.
