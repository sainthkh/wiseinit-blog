For 2 weeks, we've learned how to use 반말 present tense forms. From today, we'll cover 존댓말(polite) present tense. 

Like 반말, 존댓말 also has two forms, casual and official. In casual 존댓말 present tense, you should add -아요/-어요 after verb stems. -아요/-어요 form is more frequently used in conversation than official form. 

#  Basic Form

As 아요/어요 form starts with vowel, you should be careful about the irregular verbs. 

고기 구워요.
I am roasting meats. 

우리는 매일 아침 운동해요. 
We work out every morning. 

놀이터에서 놀아요. 
He's now playing in the playground. 


#  Question

When you want to ask some questions in casual 존댓말 present tense. Just raise the end of the sentence. 

고기 구워요?
Are you roasting meats?

매일 아침 운동해요?
Are you working out every morning?

#  -세요 form.

If you want to be more polite, you can use the -(으)세요 ending. If the verb stem ends with a consonant like 읽다, 숨다, you should use 으세요 like 읽으세요, 숨으세요. However, if it ends with a vowel like 보다, 가다, just use 세요 like 보세요, 가세요. Like always, it starts with a vowel, so you should be careful about irregular verbs. 

A: 뭐 읽으세요?
B: 어제 야구 경기 결과요. 
A: What are you reading?
B: Yesterday's results of the baseball matches.

A: 어떤 방송 자주 보세요?
