We learned that "-겠" is used only with the first person(I or we). However, there are some exceptions. We'll learn those exceptions today. 

# "겠습니다" for announcement of a segment in event

First of all, "-겠습니다" is used to speak what will happen right after the announcement. In every ceremony and event, there is an order of small segments. This "-겠습니다" is used to tell the next event that will happen shortly. 

지금부터 교장 선생님 말씀이 있으시겠습니다. 
From now on, the principal will talk. 

그 부분은 제가 아니라 영희가 답변하겠습니다. 
About that part, 영희 will answer instead of me. 

다음 순서로는 레드 벨벳의 공연이 있겠습니다. 
The next segment is the show of Red Velvet.

As you can see, the subject of these sentences are not "I" or "we". 

One more thing to note is that you cannot find this usage with other "겠" families like "-게", "-겠다", "-게요". It is only applied to "-겠습니다".

# 겠 for guessing or expecting

When you are guessing or expecting something, 겠 can be used with the second or third person. 

딸이 서울대에 갔으니 좋으시겠어요. 
Your daughter entered Seoul National University. You must be proud of her. 

아까 다 사갔다니까 지금 가면 없겠네.
It is said that they bought them all not long ago. So, there must be nothing. 

오늘만 하면 다 끝나겠네. 
If we do that today, it must be done.
