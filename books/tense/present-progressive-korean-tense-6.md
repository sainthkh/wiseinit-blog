We've learned present tense. So, let's continue with present progressive tense. It's "be -ing" tense in English. It is used to describe what you are doing now. In Korean, you can use both present and present progressive tense for current situation. If you want to emphasize what you are doing now, you should use present progressive tense. In Korean, it's "-고 있다". Fortunately, it starts with 고. So, there is no irregular conjugation. Just get rid of 다 and add 고. It's all done!

In the last 4 episodes, we've learned 4 types of polite levels in present tense. In present progressive tense, it's still true. They are "-고 있어", "-고 있다", "-고 있어요", "-고 있습니다". As you can see, each rule is applied to the verb, 있다. 

Let's see with examples. 

어디야?
지금 집에 가고 있어. 
Where are you?
I am going back home. 

뭐 해?
고기 굽고 있어. 
What are you doing?
Roasting meats.

애들은 뭐 하고 있어?
공부해.
What are the kids doing?
They're studying. 

As you can see, in many cases, you can use present and present progressive tense interchangeably in Korean if you want to talk about the current situation. Present progressive is rarely used to describe habits.
